LocalAI binaries are available for both Linux and MacOS platforms and can be executed directly from your command line. These binaries are continuously updated and hosted on [our GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/mudler/LocalAI/releases). This method also supports Windows users via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

### macOS Download

Binaries do have limited support compared to container images:

- Python-based backends are not shipped with binaries (e.g. `bark`, `diffusers` or `transformers`)
- MacOS binaries and Linux-arm64 do not ship TTS nor `stablediffusion-cpp` backends
- Linux binaries do not ship `stablediffusion-cpp` backend
