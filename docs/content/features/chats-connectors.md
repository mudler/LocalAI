The Connectors page of the [chats](/features/chats/) has two kinds of connector:

- **Telegram** binds a bot to one of your agents, so a person can talk to it from Telegram. This is the first half of this page.
- **MCP server** gives your chats and agents more tools. See [MCP servers](#mcp-servers).

## Telegram

A Telegram connector binds a bot to one of your [saved agents](/features/chats-agents/).
A person who messages the bot talks to that agent, in a conversation of their
own, and the answer comes back in Telegram. The conversation is a
[chat](/features/chats/) of yours: it uses your quota and your model allowlist,
and you can open it in LocalAI.

### Set up a binding

1. Make a bot with `@BotFather` in Telegram and copy its token.
2. Make an agent that names a model. A connector has no model of its own, so
   an agent without a model cannot be bound.
3. On the Connectors page, make a binding: a name, the token, the agent, and who
   may use it.
4. Use **Test**. LocalAI asks Telegram which bot the token belongs to.
5. Write to the bot from an account on the allowlist.

```
curl -X POST .../api/chats/connectors -d '{"name": "Support bot", "token": "123:abc", "agent_id": "<id>", "enabled": true, "allow": ["12345678"]}'
curl -X POST .../api/chats/connectors/<id>/test
curl .../api/chats/connectors/<id>/senders
```

`GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE /api/chats/connectors/{id}` read, replace and delete a
binding. `POST .../enable` and `.../disable` switch it. You can have 10 bindings.

## What a message gets

- **The agent's tools only.** A message gets exactly the tools the agent grants,
  intersected with what you may use now. It never gets the tool set of a chat, and
  a message cannot change the agent. A run started by a connector never gets
  `propose_trigger`.
- **Your account.** The chat acts as you, so the feature gate, the model
  allowlist and your quota apply. If the model refuses the request, the sender
  gets one fixed sentence, for example that your quota is used up.
- **One chat for each sender.** Each person who writes to the bot has a chat of
  their own with the agent. They cannot see another person's chat. If you change
  the agent of the binding, the next message of each sender starts a new chat
  with the new agent.
- **Text only.** A photo, voice note or file gets a sentence that says only text
  is read for now. A message longer than 8,000 characters is refused. A sender may
  send 20 messages a minute; more are dropped, with one notice a minute.
- **Private chats only.** A message in a group that the bot was added to is
  ignored.
- **Answers.** The bot sends the final answer of each turn, split at 4,096
  characters (the limit of Telegram), and shows "typing" while it works. A message
  that arrives while the agent works waits and is read at the agent's next request,
  as in any chat; the answer of that turn covers it.

## Who may use the bot

The allowlist decides. It is empty when you make a binding, so the bot accepts
nobody. List chat IDs, user IDs or `@usernames`.

A message from anyone else is ignored: it is not answered, and the sender goes
in the sender log with a count. Open **Senders** on the binding to see who tried,
and use **Allow** to add a person to the allowlist.

"Anyone who can message the bot" (`accept_any`) lets everyone use the agent. The
server asks you to confirm it, because anyone who can find the bot can then use
the agent's tools as you: the request that turns it on, a create with
`accept_any` or an update that changes it from off to on, must also carry
`"confirm_accept_any": "accept any message"`, or it is a `400`. The page does
this with a confirmation. A binding that already has it keeps it on later edits,
and turning it off needs no confirmation. Use it for a public bot whose agent
grants nothing you would mind sharing.

## Notifications in Telegram

Set a notification chat ID on a binding to receive your run notifications there
too (a trigger that finished or failed, for example). The title and the text are
sent, not the link. Find your chat ID by writing to the bot and reading the sender
log.

## The bot token

The token is a secret. LocalAI seals it with AES-256-GCM and ties it to its
binding. No API returns it: a binding only says `has_token`. To change it, send a
new one with an update; an update without a token keeps the old one. The key is
`connectors.key` (mode `0600`) under the data path, or a row of the database that
every frontend shares. LocalAI refuses a key file that other users can read.

LocalAI only calls `https://api.telegram.org`. It reads updates by long polling,
so it needs no public address.

## When a binding switches itself off

A binding is switched off, and you get a notification, when Telegram refuses the
token, when another process keeps reading the updates of the same bot (Telegram
allows one reader; a new leader in a cluster waits and retries for about a minute
before it gives up), when the agent is deleted or has no model, or when the owner no longer
exists. Fix the cause and switch it on.

## Storage and clusters

Bindings, the read position in Telegram's updates, the sender log and the chat of
each sender are stored with your chats: in the database, in JSON files under the
data path, or in memory when there is no data path (then nothing survives a
restart). The JSON store is for one process.

| State | Mode | How |
|---|---|---|
| Bindings, offsets, sender log, sender chats, the key | Shared | Rows in the database. |
| Which frontend reads the bot | Single runner | The frontend that holds the advisory lock (`KeyChatsConnectors`). When it stops, another takes the lock and continues from the stored offset. |
| The reply being sent for a turn | Per instance | The frontend that took the message sends the answer. If it dies, the answer is lost; the message is not repeated. |

### Other connectors

Only Telegram and MCP servers are built. Slack, Discord, IRC, Matrix, email, GitHub and Twitter
connectors of the old agents are not rebuilt; the release that removes the old
agents lists them as dropped.

## MCP servers

An MCP connector is an MCP server that you define. It is stored on the server,
as one of your records, so every browser and session of yours sees the same list.
(The old chat page kept such servers in the browser and reached them through a
proxy; see [Import from this browser](#import-from-this-browser).)

A connector is yours alone. Another user never sees, edits, tests or uses it.
You need the `mcp` feature, and `LOCALAI_DISABLE_MCP` turns it off for the
whole instance. Both are checked each time a chat uses a connector, not only
when you save it.

### Add one

On the Connectors page choose **MCP server**, then **New MCP server**. Give it a
name (unique among your connectors) and an address, and optionally a bearer
token or other headers. Use **Test connection** to connect and list the tool
names before you switch it on.

```
curl -X POST .../api/chats/mcp-connectors -d '{"name": "Docs", "transport": "http", "url": "https://mcp.example/mcp", "token": "...", "headers": {"X-Team": "blue"}, "enabled": false}'
curl -X POST .../api/chats/mcp-connectors/<id>/test
# {"ok": true, "tools": ["search", "fetch"]}
curl -X POST .../api/chats/mcp-connectors/<id>/enable
```

`GET`, `PUT` and `DELETE /api/chats/mcp-connectors/{id}` read, replace and
delete one, and `POST .../enable` and `.../disable` switch it. You can have 20.
A test of a server that cannot be used is a `200` with `ok: false` and the
reason.

| Transport | What it is |
|---|---|
| `http` | A remote server. Streamable HTTP is tried first and the legacy SSE transport is the fall back. The address must be `http` or `https`, with no user name or password in it. |
| `stdio` | A command run on the host of the frontend, with `command`, `args` and `env`. Administrators only, and refused in distributed mode. |

OAuth sign-in for remote servers is not supported: use a token or a header.
A tool of a connector can have an interactive page; see [MCP Apps](#mcp-apps).

### Secrets

The token, the headers and the environment of a command are sealed in the
database or the JSON files, with the same key and the same method as the Telegram
tokens, and tied to the connector and its owner. They are write-only: the API
returns only `has_token`, `has_headers` and `has_env`. A `PUT` that leaves them
out keeps the stored values; an empty value clears them. They are never logged,
never put into a tool result or the model's context, and an error message never
repeats them or the query of the address.

### Which addresses a connector may reach

A connector makes the server connect to an address you choose. To stop it being
used to probe the internal network, a connector may reach only public hosts:

- The check is made **when the connection is opened**, on every address the name
  resolves to, and on every redirect. A name whose answer changes between the
  check and the connection (DNS rebinding) is refused too.
- Loopback, link-local, private (RFC 1918 and unique local), shared address space,
  cloud metadata and unspecified addresses are refused, for IPv4 and IPv6.
- An address that is plainly internal (an IP literal or `localhost`) is refused
  when you save or switch on a connector. A disabled connector may be saved with
  one, so that an import or a conversion can make it, but it cannot be switched on.

An administrator can allow private addresses with the runtime setting
`mcp_connectors_allow_private` (Settings, Access and security; default off; no
restart needed). Turn it on only when your users are trusted: with it, a connector
can reach services on the server's own network. Turning it off closes the open
sessions that were made to such addresses: a tool handed out before is refused,
and the next turn connects again under the new rule. Likewise, a user who stops
being an administrator loses their running local commands at their next use.

A local command (`stdio`) runs without a shell, with a minimal environment
(`PATH`, `HOME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TMPDIR`, `TZ`) plus the variables you sealed, and with a
time limit to start and to answer. It runs on the frontend, as the LocalAI process.

### How chats use them

- **A chat with no agent** gets the tools of all your enabled connectors, next to
  the MCP servers its model has.
- **A saved agent** names a connector as `connector:<id>` in its `mcp_servers` list;
  a name without the prefix is a server of the model. The agent form lists both.
  The agent holds the ID, so renaming a connector does not break it.
- **A connector that cannot be used** (switched off, deleted, not yours, the
  address refused or the server down) gives the model a note, "unavailable this
  turn: MCP connector Docs (cannot be reached)", and never fails the turn.
- **Triggers and sub-agents** follow the rules of agents: a trigger with an agent
  gets what the agent names; a sub-agent gets the tools its parent names.
- **Tool names.** A tool cannot take the name of a built-in tool or the add-on
  namespace; it is dropped. When two connectors (or a connector and the model)
  offer a tool with the same name, each gets the connector's name in front:
  `Docs_search`, `Mail_search`.
- **Limits.** A call has a time limit of 60 seconds, and its output is cut at 64 KiB like the output of the chat's own tools.
- **Per chat switches.** The tools panel of a chat lists the connectors and the
  model's MCP servers with a switch each. See [Chats](/features/chats/#mcp-tools).

### MCP Apps

A connector can offer MCP Apps: tools that declare an interactive HTML page in
`_meta.ui.resourceUri`. Chats show the page under the tool line as soon as the
call ends, while the turn goes on. The server
holds the MCP connection, so the page works for a connector like any other tool:
the page is read from the connector, and its tool calls go to the connector,
with the connector's own credential. The credential never reaches the browser.

- Only the owner's chat, with the connector enabled and not switched off in the
  tools panel of that chat, can read a page or call a tool for it. A saved agent
  must name the connector.
- Only a `ui://` resource that a tool of the connector declares is read.
- A tool whose `_meta.ui.visibility` does not include `"app"` cannot be called
  by a page. A tool whose visibility does not include `"model"` is not offered
  to the model.

See [Chats](/features/chats/#interactive-tool-pages-mcp-apps) for the routes and
the sandbox.

### Import from this browser

If the old chat page kept MCP servers in this browser (`localStorage`), the
MCP page offers **Import N servers from this browser**. It shows each name and
address, never a header value, and makes a switched-off connector for each one.
A token or header leaves the browser only for a server the API accepted; the
ones that failed stay in the browser with the reason.

### Storage and clusters

| State | Mode | How |
|---|---|---|
| The connectors and their sealed secrets | Shared | Rows in the database (JSON files under the data path for one process). |
| The sealing key | Shared | The key of the Telegram connectors. |
| Open MCP sessions | Per instance | Each frontend opens its own sessions, lazily, for its own users' calls, and closes them after 10 idle minutes and when a connector is edited, switched off or deleted. A frontend notices an edit made on another by the record's update time at the next use. A session is never shared between users. |
| Local commands (`stdio`) | Refused | They would run on whichever frontend served the request. |

Remote connectors connect from the frontend that runs the turn, not from an
agent worker, so a server must be reachable from every frontend.
