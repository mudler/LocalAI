LocalAI provides a comprehensive set of features for running AI models locally. This section covers all the capabilities and functionalities available in LocalAI.

## Core Features

- **[Text Generation](text-generation/)** - Generate text with GPT-compatible models using various backends
- **[Image Generation](image-generation/)** - Create images with Stable Diffusion and other diffusion models
- **[Audio Processing](audio-to-text/)** - Transcribe audio to text and generate speech from text
- **[Embeddings](embeddings/)** - Generate vector embeddings for semantic search and RAG applications
- **[GPT Vision](gpt-vision/)** - Analyze and understand images with vision-language models

## Advanced Features

- **[OpenAI Functions](openai-functions/)** - Use function calling and tools API with local models
- **[Constrained Grammars](constrained_grammars/)** - Control model output format with BNF grammars
- **[GPU Acceleration](GPU-acceleration/)** - Optimize performance with GPU support
- **[Distributed Inference](distributed_inferencing/)** - Scale inference across multiple nodes
- **[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](mcp/)** - Enable agentic capabilities with MCP integration

## Specialized Features

- **[Object Detection](object-detection/)** - Detect and locate objects in images
- **[Reranker](reranker/)** - Improve retrieval accuracy with cross-encoder models
- **[Stores](stores/)** - Vector similarity search for embeddings
- **[Model Gallery](model-gallery/)** - Browse and install pre-configured models
- **[Backends](backends/)** - Learn about available backends and how to manage them
- **[Runtime Settings](runtime-settings/)** - Configure application settings via web UI without restarting

## Getting Started

To start using these features, make sure you have [LocalAI installed](/installation/) and have [downloaded some models](/getting-started/models/). Then explore the feature pages above to learn how to use each capability.
