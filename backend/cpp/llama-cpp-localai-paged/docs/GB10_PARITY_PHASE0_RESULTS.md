  HEAD.

## Existing Artifact Gap Review

Read-only DGX artifact inspection was performed after confirming the machine was
idle: `docker ps` returned no running containers,
`nvidia-smi --query-compute-apps` returned no compute-app rows, and
`~/gpu_bench_lock/owner` read
`FREE released-by-claude-fp4norm-profile 1782828229`.

Existing paged llama.cpp decode and prefill numbers are supported by
`/home/mudler/bench/COMBINED_DEFINITIVE.txt`: MoE paged prefill lines 13-18,
MoE paged serving decode lines 23-26, dense paged prefill lines 43-48, and
dense paged serving decode lines 53-56. Supporting comparison artifacts are
`/home/mudler/bench/STOCK3WAY.txt`, `/home/mudler/bench/PREFILL_KNOB.txt`,
`/home/mudler/bench/DEFINITIVE_S3ab.txt`, and the adjacent raw logs.

No self-contained vLLM `1078 t/s` GPU-steady `ntg16`/`ntg64`
difference-method artifact was found. The available vLLM evidence is
serving-run output in `/home/mudler/bench/COMBINED_DEFINITIVE.txt` plus
nsys/run artifacts under `/home/mudler/bench/profgap/` and
`/home/mudler/bench/postssm_decomp/`; these do not form a packaged
`ntg16`/`ntg64` difference-method report.

W4A16/Marlin evidence exists in `/home/mudler/bench/vllm_prefix.log`,
`/home/mudler/bench/profgap/vllm_moe_decode.run.log`, and
`/home/mudler/bench/marlin_gate/kl_marlin.log`.
`/home/mudler/llama-paged-dev/LEVER3_ACTQUANT_FUSION_RESULTS.md` records the
parity conclusion: W4A16/Marlin is a precision-change lever, not a bit-exact
llama.cpp parity lever.

GDN M5/M8 evidence exists in `/home/mudler/bench/COMBINED_DEFINITIVE.txt`
(`GDN CONFIG C (M8)` and production defaults noting GDN M5),
`/home/mudler/llama-paged-dev/LEVER1_GATHER_RESULTS.md`, and
`/home/mudler/llama-paged-dev/CONV_STATE_FUSION_RESULTS.md`.

S3 evidence exists in `/home/mudler/bench/DEFINITIVE_S3ab.txt`; that A/B shows
S3-on was worse unless paired with `LLAMA_PAGED_PREFILL_PERIOD=1`, matching
`/home/mudler/bench/COMBINED_DEFINITIVE.txt` where S3 is recorded as off by
default. No separate self-contained adaptive-scheduling proof artifact was
found beyond the S3 and prefill-knob artifacts.

## Open Items

- Reproduce paged prefill and decode baselines.
- Find or recreate vLLM graph-node-traced difference-method decode artifacts.
