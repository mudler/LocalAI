LocalAI supports generating text with GPT with `llama.cpp` and other backends (such as `rwkv.cpp` as ) see also the [Model compatibility]({{%relref "docs/reference/compatibility-table" %}}) for an up-to-date list of the supported model families.

Note:

- You can also specify the model name as part of the OpenAI token.
- If only one model is available, the API will use it for all the requests.

## API Reference

### List models

You can list all the models available with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/models
```

## Backends

### RWKV

RWKV support is available through llama.cpp (see below)

### llama.cpp

[llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is a popular port of Facebook's LLaMA model in C/C++.

{{% alert note %}}

The `ggml` file format has been deprecated. If you are using `ggml` models and you are configuring your model with a YAML file, specify, use a LocalAI version older than v2.25.0. For `gguf` models, use the `llama` backend. The go backend is deprecated as well but still available as `go-llama`.

{{% /alert %}}

#### Features

The `llama.cpp` model supports the following features:
- [üìñ Text generation (GPT)]({{%relref "docs/features/text-generation" %}})
- [üß† Embeddings]({{%relref "docs/features/embeddings" %}})
- [üî• OpenAI functions]({{%relref "docs/features/openai-functions" %}})
- [‚úçÔ∏è Constrained grammars]({{%relref "docs/features/constrained_grammars" %}})

#### Setup

LocalAI supports `llama.cpp` models out of the box. You can use the `llama.cpp` model in the same way as any other model. 

##### Manual setup

It is sufficient to copy the `ggml` or `gguf` model files in the `models` folder. You can refer to the model in the `model` parameter in the API calls.

[You can optionally create an associated YAML]({{%relref "docs/advanced" %}}) model config file to tune the model's parameters or apply a template to the prompt.

Prompt templates are useful for models that are fine-tuned towards a specific prompt. 

##### Automatic setup

LocalAI supports model galleries which are indexes of models. For instance, the huggingface gallery contains a large curated index of models from the huggingface model hub for `ggml` or `gguf` models.

For instance, if you have the galleries enabled and LocalAI already running, you can just start chatting with models in huggingface by running:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
     "model": "TheBloke/WizardLM-13B-V1.2-GGML/wizardlm-13b-v1.2.ggmlv3.q2_K.bin",
     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}],
     "temperature": 0.1
   }'
```

LocalAI will automatically download and configure the model in the `model` directory.

Models can be also preloaded or downloaded on demand. To learn about model galleries, check out the [model gallery documentation]({{%relref "docs/features/model-gallery" %}}).

#### YAML configuration

To use the `llama.cpp` backend, specify `llama` as the backend in the YAML file:

```yaml
name: llama
backend: llama
parameters:
  # Relative to the models path
  model: file.gguf
```

#### Reference

- [llama](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)


### exllama/2

[Exllama](https://github.com/turboderp/exllama) is a "A more memory-efficient rewrite of the HF transformers implementation of Llama for use with quantized weights". Both `exllama` and `exllama2` are supported.

#### Model setup

Download the model as a folder inside the `model ` directory and create a YAML file specifying the `exllama` backend. For instance with the `TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ` model:

```
$ git lfs install
$ cd models && git clone https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ
$ ls models/                                                                 
.keep                        WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ/ exllama.yaml
$ cat models/exllama.yaml                                                     
name: exllama
parameters:
  model: WizardLM-7B-uncensored-GPTQ
backend: exllama
# Note: you can also specify "exllama2" if it's an exllama2 model here
# ...
```

Test with:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{                                                                                                         
   "model": "exllama",
   "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"}],
   "temperature": 0.1
 }'
```

### vLLM

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a fast and easy-to-use library for LLM inference.

LocalAI has a built-in integration with vLLM, and it can be used to run models. You can check out `vllm` performance [here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm#performance).

#### Setup

Create a YAML file for the model you want to use with `vllm`.

To setup a model, you need to just specify the model name in the YAML config file:
```yaml
name: vllm
backend: vllm
parameters:
    model: "facebook/opt-125m"

# Uncomment to specify a quantization method (optional)
# quantization: "awq"
# Uncomment to limit the GPU memory utilization (vLLM default is 0.9 for 90%)
# gpu_memory_utilization: 0.5
# Uncomment to trust remote code from huggingface
# trust_remote_code: true
# Uncomment to enable eager execution
# enforce_eager: true
# Uncomment to specify the size of the CPU swap space per GPU (in GiB)
# swap_space: 2
# Uncomment to specify the maximum length of a sequence (including prompt and output)
# max_model_len: 32768
# Uncomment and specify the number of Tensor divisions.
# Allows you to partition and run large models. Performance gains are limited.
# https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/1435
# tensor_parallel_size: 2
```

The backend will automatically download the required files in order to run the model.


#### Usage

Use the `completions` endpoint by specifying the `vllm` backend:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{   
   "model": "vllm",
   "prompt": "Hello, my name is",
   "temperature": 0.1, "top_p": 0.1
 }'
```

### Transformers

[Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) is a State-of-the-art Machine Learning library for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

LocalAI has a built-in integration with Transformers, and it can be used to run models.

This is an extra backend - in the container images (the `extra` images already contains python dependencies for Transformers) is already available and there is nothing to do for the setup.

#### Setup

Create a YAML file for the model you want to use with `transformers`.

To setup a model, you need to just specify the model name in the YAML config file:
```yaml
name: transformers
backend: transformers
parameters:
    model: "facebook/opt-125m"
type: AutoModelForCausalLM
quantization: bnb_4bit # One of: bnb_8bit, bnb_4bit, xpu_4bit, xpu_8bit (optional)
```

The backend will automatically download the required files in order to run the model.

#### Parameters

##### Type

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AutoModelForCausalLM` | `AutoModelForCausalLM` is a model that can be used to generate sequences. Use it for NVIDIA CUDA and Intel GPU with Intel Extensions for Pytorch acceleration |
| `OVModelForCausalLM` | for Intel CPU/GPU/NPU OpenVINO Text Generation models |
| `OVModelForFeatureExtraction` | for Intel CPU/GPU/NPU OpenVINO Embedding acceleration |
| N/A | Defaults to `AutoModel` |

- `OVModelForCausalLM` requires OpenVINO IR [Text Generation](https://huggingface.co/models?library=openvino&pipeline_tag=text-generation) models from Hugging face
- `OVModelForFeatureExtraction` works with any Safetensors Transformer [Feature Extraction](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=feature-extraction&library=transformers,safetensors) model from Huggingface (Embedding Model)

Please note that streaming is currently not implemented in `AutoModelForCausalLM` for Intel GPU.
AMD GPU support is not implemented.
Although AMD CPU is not officially supported by OpenVINO there are reports that it works: YMMV.

##### Embeddings
Use `embeddings: true` if the model is an embedding model

##### Inference device selection
Transformer backend tries to automatically select the best device for inference, anyway you can override the decision manually overriding with the `main_gpu` parameter.

| Inference Engine | Applicable Values |
| --- | --- |
| CUDA | `cuda`, `cuda.X` where X is the GPU device like in `nvidia-smi -L` output |
| OpenVINO | Any applicable value from [Inference Modes](https://docs.openvino.ai/2024/openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes.html) like `AUTO`,`CPU`,`GPU`,`NPU`,`MULTI`,`HETERO` |

Example for CUDA:
`main_gpu: cuda.0`

Example for OpenVINO:
`main_gpu: AUTO:-CPU`

This parameter applies to both Text Generation and Feature Extraction (i.e. Embeddings) models.

##### Inference Precision
Transformer backend automatically select the fastest applicable inference precision according to the device support.
CUDA backend can manually enable *bfloat16* if your hardware support it with the following parameter:

`f16: true`

##### Quantization

| Quantization | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `bnb_8bit` | 8-bit quantization |
| `bnb_4bit` | 4-bit quantization |
| `xpu_8bit` | 8-bit quantization for Intel XPUs |
| `xpu_4bit` | 4-bit quantization for Intel XPUs |

##### Trust Remote Code
Some models like Microsoft Phi-3 requires external code than what is provided by the transformer library.
By default it is disabled for security.
It can be manually enabled with:
`trust_remote_code: true`

##### Maximum Context Size
Maximum context size in bytes can be specified with the parameter: `context_size`. Do not use values higher than what your model support.

Usage example:
`context_size: 8192`

##### Auto Prompt Template
Usually chat template is defined by the model author in the `tokenizer_config.json` file.
To enable it use the `use_tokenizer_template: true` parameter in the `template` section.

Usage example:
```
template:
  use_tokenizer_template: true
```

##### Custom Stop Words
Stopwords are usually defined in `tokenizer_config.json` file.
They can be overridden with the `stopwords` parameter in case of need like in llama3-Instruct model.

Usage example:
```
stopwords:
- "<|eot_id|>"
- "<|end_of_text|>"
```

#### Usage

Use the `completions` endpoint by specifying the `transformers` model:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/completions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{   
   "model": "transformers",
   "prompt": "Hello, my name is",
   "temperature": 0.1, "top_p": 0.1
 }'
```

#### Examples

##### OpenVINO

A model configuration file for openvion and starling model:

```yaml
name: starling-openvino
backend: transformers
parameters:
  model: fakezeta/Starling-LM-7B-beta-openvino-int8
context_size: 8192
threads: 6
f16: true
type: OVModelForCausalLM
stopwords:
- <|end_of_turn|>
- <|endoftext|>
prompt_cache_path: "cache"
prompt_cache_all: true
template:
  chat_message: |
    {{if eq .RoleName "system"}}{{.Content}}<|end_of_turn|>{{end}}{{if eq .RoleName "assistant"}}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant: {{.Content}}<|end_of_turn|>{{end}}{{if eq .RoleName "user"}}GPT4 Correct User: {{.Content}}{{end}}

  chat: |
    {{.Input}}<|end_of_turn|>GPT4 Correct Assistant:

  completion: |
    {{.Input}}
```
