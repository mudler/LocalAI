  description: |
      AI21’s Jamba Reasoning 3B is a top-performing reasoning model that packs leading scores on intelligence benchmarks and highly-efficient processing into a compact 3B build.
      The hybrid design combines Transformer attention with Mamba (a state-space model). Mamba layers are more efficient for sequence processing, while attention layers capture complex dependencies. This mix reduces memory overhead, improves throughput, and makes the model run smoothly on laptops, GPUs, and even mobile devices, while maintainig impressive quality.

    We introduce InternVL3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD) strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs, effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0% gain in overall reasoning performance and a 4.05 ×\times× inference speedup compared to its predecessor, i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e., InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks—narrowing the performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code are publicly released.

    LFM2‑VL is Liquid AI's first series of multimodal models, designed to process text and images with variable resolutions. Built on the LFM2 backbone, it is optimized for low-latency and edge AI applications.
    We're releasing the weights of two post-trained checkpoints with 450M (for highly constrained devices) and 1.6B (more capable yet still lightweight) parameters.

        2× faster inference speed on GPUs compared to existing VLMs while maintaining competitive accuracy
        Flexible architecture with user-tunable speed-quality tradeoffs at inference time
        Native resolution processing up to 512×512 with intelligent patch-based handling for larger images, avoiding upscaling and distortion

  description: |
    Welcome to the gpt-oss series, OpenAI’s open-weight models designed for powerful reasoning, agentic tasks, and versatile developer use cases.

    We’re releasing two flavors of the open models:

        gpt-oss-120b — for production, general purpose, high reasoning use cases that fits into a single H100 GPU (117B parameters with 5.1B active parameters)
        gpt-oss-20b — for lower latency, and local or specialized use cases (21B parameters with 3.6B active parameters)

    Both models were trained on our harmony response format and should only be used with the harmony format as it will not work correctly otherwise.

        This model card is dedicated to the smaller gpt-oss-20b model. Check out gpt-oss-120b for the larger model.

    Highlights

        Permissive Apache 2.0 license: Build freely without copyleft restrictions or patent risk—ideal for experimentation, customization, and commercial deployment.
        Configurable reasoning effort: Easily adjust the reasoning effort (low, medium, high) based on your specific use case and latency needs.
        Full chain-of-thought: Gain complete access to the model’s reasoning process, facilitating easier debugging and increased trust in outputs. It’s not intended to be shown to end users.
        Fine-tunable: Fully customize models to your specific use case through parameter fine-tuning.
        Agentic capabilities: Use the models’ native capabilities for function calling, web browsing, Python code execution, and Structured Outputs.
        Native MXFP4 quantization: The models are trained with native MXFP4 precision for the MoE layer, making gpt-oss-120b run on a single H100 GPU and the gpt-oss-20b model run within 16GB of memory.

    (Forcing the model to create code with no dependencies and limits of coding short cuts, with multiple loops, and in real time with no blocking in a language that does not support it normally.)

    Due to quanting issues with this model (which result in oddball quant sizes / mixtures), only TESTED quants will be uploaded (at the moment).

    These are NEO Imatrix GGUFs, NEO dataset by DavidAU.

    NEO dataset improves overall performance, and is for all use cases.

    This model uses Huihui-gpt-oss-20b-BF16-abliterated as a base which DE-CENSORS the model and removes refusals.

    Example output below (creative; IQ4_NL), using settings below.

    This model can be a little rough around the edges (due to abliteration) ; make sure you see the settings below for best operation.

    It can also be creative, off the shelf crazy and rational too.

    Enjoy!

    AFM-4.5B is a 4.5 billion parameter instruction-tuned model developed by Arcee.ai, designed for enterprise-grade performance across diverse deployment environments from cloud to edge. The base model was trained on a dataset of 8 trillion tokens, comprising 6.5 trillion tokens of general pretraining data followed by 1.5 trillion tokens of midtraining data with enhanced focus on mathematical reasoning and code generation. Following pretraining, the model underwent supervised fine-tuning on high-quality instruction datasets. The instruction-tuned model was further refined through reinforcement learning on verifiable rewards as well as for human preference. We use a modified version of TorchTitan for pretraining, Axolotl for supervised fine-tuning, and a modified version of Verifiers for reinforcement learning.

    The development of AFM-4.5B prioritized data quality as a fundamental requirement for achieving robust model performance. We collaborated with DatologyAI, a company specializing in large-scale data curation. DatologyAI's curation pipeline integrates a suite of proprietary algorithms—model-based quality filtering, embedding-based curation, target distribution-matching, source mixing, and synthetic data. Their expertise enabled the creation of a curated dataset tailored to support strong real-world performance.

    The model architecture follows a standard transformer decoder-only design based on Vaswani et al., incorporating several key modifications for enhanced performance and efficiency. Notable architectural features include grouped query attention for improved inference efficiency and ReLU^2 activation functions instead of SwiGLU to enable sparsification while maintaining or exceeding performance benchmarks.

    The model available in this repo is the instruct model following supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

    RF-DETR is a real-time, transformer-based object detection model architecture developed by Roboflow and released under the Apache 2.0 license.
    RF-DETR is the first real-time model to exceed 60 AP on the Microsoft COCO benchmark alongside competitive performance at base sizes. It also achieves state-of-the-art performance on RF100-VL, an object detection benchmark that measures model domain adaptability to real world problems. RF-DETR is fastest and most accurate for its size when compared current real-time objection models.
    RF-DETR is small enough to run on the edge using Inference, making it an ideal model for deployments that need both strong accuracy and real-time performance.

    By applying SFT and GRPO on difficult math problems, we enhanced the performance of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B and developed Fast-Math-R1-14B, which achieves approx. 30% faster inference on average, while maintaining accuracy.

    In addition, we trained and open-sourced Fast-Math-Qwen3-14B, an efficiency-optimized version of Qwen3-14B`, following the same approach.

    Compared to Qwen3-14B, this model enables approx. 65% faster inference on average, with minimal loss in performance.

    Technical details can be found in our github repository.

    Note: This model likely inherits the ability to perform inference in TIR mode from the original model. However, all of our experiments were conducted in CoT mode, and its performance in TIR mode has not been evaluated.

    The JOSIEFIED model family represents a series of highly advanced language models built upon renowned architectures such as Alibaba’s Qwen2/2.5/3, Google’s Gemma3, and Meta’s LLaMA3/4. Covering sizes from 0.5B to 32B parameters, these models have been significantly modified (“abliterated”) and further fine-tuned to maximize uncensored behavior without compromising tool usage or instruction-following abilities.
    Despite their rebellious spirit, the JOSIEFIED models often outperform their base counterparts on standard benchmarks — delivering both raw power and utility.
    These models are intended for advanced users who require unrestricted, high-performance language generation.
    Introducing Josiefied-Qwen3-8B-abliterated-v1, a new addition to the JOSIEFIED family — fine-tuned with a focus on openness and instruction alignment.

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    This is a simple "finetune" of the Qwen's "Qwen 30B-A3B" (MOE) model, setting the experts in use from 8 to 4 (out of 128 experts).

    This method close to doubles the speed of the model and uses 1.5B (of 30B) parameters instead of 3B (of 30B) parameters. Depending on the application you may want to use the regular model ("30B-A3B"), and use this model for simpler use case(s) although I did not notice any loss of function during routine (but not extensive) testing.

    Example generation (Q4KS, CPU) at the bottom of this page using 4 experts / this model.

    More complex use cases may benefit from using the normal version.

    For reference:

        Cpu only operation Q4KS (windows 11) jumps from 12 t/s to 23 t/s.
        GPU performance IQ3S jumps from 75 t/s to over 125 t/s. (low to mid level card)

    A man-made horror beyond your comprehension.

    But no, seriously, this is my experiment to:

        measure the probability that any given expert will activate (over my personal set of fairly diverse calibration data), per layer
        prune 64/128 of the least used experts per layer (with reordered router and indexing per layer)

    It can still write semi-coherently without any additional training or distillation done on top of it from the original 30b MoE. The .txt files with the original measurements are provided in the repo along with the exported weights.

    Custom testing to measure the experts was done on a hacked version of vllm, and then I made a bespoke script to selectively export the weights according to the measurements.

    This is an uncensored version of Qwen/Qwen3-14B created with abliteration (see remove-refusals-with-transformers to know more about it). This is a crude, proof-of-concept implementation to remove refusals from an LLM model without using TransformerLens.

    Ablation was performed using a new and faster method, which yields better results.

    Note: This model is a Qwen 30B MoE prototype and can be considered a sidegrade from my Small release some time ago. It did not receive extensive testing beyond a couple benchmarks to determine its sanity, so feel free to let me know what you think of it!

    Welcome to the next iteration of my Pantheon model series, in which I strive to introduce a whole collection of diverse personas that can be summoned with a simple activation phrase.

    Pantheon's purpose is two-fold, as these personalities similarly enhance the general roleplay experience, helping to encompass personality traits, accents and mannerisms that language models might otherwise find difficult to convey well.

    GGUF quants are available here.

    Your user feedback is critical to me so don't hesitate to tell me whether my model is either 1. terrible, 2. awesome or 3. somewhere in-between.
    Model details

    Ever since Qwen 3 released I've been trying to get MoE finetuning to work - After countless frustrating days, much code hacking, etc etc I finally got a full finetune to complete with reasonable loss values.

    I picked the base model for this since I didn't feel like trying to fight a reasoning model's training - Maybe someday I'll make a model which uses thinking tags for the character's thoughts or something.

    This time the recipe focused on combining as many data sources as I possibly could, featuring synthetic data from Sonnet 3.5 + 3.7, ChatGPT 4o and Deepseek. These then went through an extensive rewriting pipeline to eliminate common AI cliches, with the hopeful intent of providing you a fresh experience.

    The JOSIEFIED model family represents a series of highly advanced language models built upon renowned architectures such as Alibaba’s Qwen2/2.5/3, Google’s Gemma3, and Meta’s LLaMA 3/4. Covering sizes from 0.5B to 32B parameters, these models have been significantly modified (“abliterated”) and further fine-tuned to maximize uncensored behavior without compromising tool usage or instruction-following abilities.

    Despite their rebellious spirit, the JOSIEFIED models often outperform their base counterparts on standard benchmarks — delivering both raw power and utility.
    These models are intended for advanced users who require unrestricted, high-performance language generation. Introducing Josiefied-Qwen3-14B-abliterated-v3, a new addition to the JOSIEFIED family — fine-tuned with a focus on openness and instruction alignment.

        Reduced repetitions and impersonation

        To add to the creativity and out of the box thinking of RpR v3, a more advanced filtering method was used in order to remove examples where the LLM repeated similar phrases or talked for the user. Any repetition or impersonation cases that happens will be due to how the base QwQ model was trained, and not because of the RpR dataset.

        Increased training sequence length

        The training sequence length was increased to 16K in order to help awareness and memory even on longer chats.

    This model is for all use cases, but excels in creative use cases specifically.

    This model is based on Qwen3-30B-A3B (MOE, 128 experts, 8 activated), with Brainstorm 40X (by DavidAU - details at bottom of this page.

    This is the refined version -V1.3- from this project (see this repo for all settings, details, system prompts, example generations etc etc):

    Qwen3-55B-A3B-TOTAL-RECALL-Deep-40X-GGUF

    A highly experimental model ("tamer" versions below) based on Qwen3-30B-A3B (MOE, 128 experts, 8 activated), with Brainstorm 40X (by DavidAU - details at bottom of this page).

    These modifications blow the model (V1) out to 87 layers, 1046 tensors and 55B parameters.

    Note that some versions are smaller than this, with fewer layers/tensors and smaller parameter counts.

    The adapter extensively alters performance, reasoning and output generation.

    Exceptional changes in creative, prose and general performance.

    Regens of the same prompt - even with the same settings - will be very different.

    THREE example generations below - creative (generated with Q3_K_M, V1 model).

    ONE example generation (#4) - non creative (generated with Q3_K_M, V1 model).

    You can run this model on CPU and/or GPU due to unique model construction, size of experts and total activated experts at 3B parameters (8 experts), which translates into roughly almost 6B parameters in this version.

    Two quants uploaded for testing: Q3_K_M, Q4_K_M

    V3, V4 and V5 are also available in these two quants.

    V2 and V6 in Q3_k_m only; as are: V 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.7 and V7 (newest)

    NOTE: V2 and up are from source model 2, V1 and 1.3,1.4,1.5,1.7 are from source model 1.

    Qwen3-42B-A3B-Stranger-Thoughts-Deep20x-Abliterated-Uncensored

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    ABOUT:

    Qwen's excellent "Qwen3-30B-A3B", abliterated by "huihui-ai" then combined Brainstorm 20x (tech notes at bottom of the page) in a MOE (128 experts) at 42B parameters (up from 30B).

    This pushes Qwen's abliterated/uncensored model to the absolute limit for creative use cases.

    Prose (all), reasoning, thinking ... all will be very different from reg "Qwen 3s".

    This model will generate horror, fiction, erotica, - you name it - in vivid, stark detail.

    It will NOT hold back.

    Likewise, regen(s) of the same prompt - even at the same settings - will create very different version(s) too.

    See FOUR examples below.

    Model retains full reasoning, and output generation of a Qwen3 MOE ; but has not been tested for "non-creative" use cases.

    Model is set with Qwen's default config:

        40 k context
        8 of 128 experts activated.
        Chatml OR Jinja Template (embedded)

    IMPORTANT:

    See usage guide / repo below to get the most out of this model, as settings are very specific.

    USAGE GUIDE:

    Please refer to this model card for

        Specific usage, suggested settings, changing ACTIVE EXPERTS, templates, settings and the like:
        How to maximize this model in "uncensored" form, with specific notes on "abliterated" models.

    Qwen3-22B-A3B-The-Harley-Quinn

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    ABOUT:

    A stranger, yet radically different version of Kalmaze's "Qwen/Qwen3-16B-A3B" with the experts pruned to 64 (from 128, the Qwen 3 30B-A3B version) and then I added 19 layers expanding (Brainstorm 20x by DavidAU info at bottom of this page) the model to 22B total parameters.

    The goal: slightly alter the model, to address some odd creative thinking and output choices.

    Then... Harley Quinn showed up, and then it was a party!

    A wild, out of control (sometimes) but never boring party.

    Please note that the modifications affect the entire model operation; roughly I adjusted the model to think a little "deeper" and "ponder" a bit - but this is a very rough description.

    That being said, reasoning and output generation will be altered regardless of your use case(s).

    These modifications pushes Qwen's model to the absolute limit for creative use cases.

    Detail, vividiness, and creativity all get a boost.

    Prose (all) will also be very different from "default" Qwen3.

    Likewise, regen(s) of the same prompt - even at the same settings - will create very different version(s) too.

    The Brainstrom 20x has also lightly de-censored the model under some conditions.

    However, this model can be prone to bouts of madness.

    It will not always behave, and it will sometimes go -wildly- off script.

    See 4 examples below.

    Model retains full reasoning, and output generation of a Qwen3 MOE ; but has not been tested for "non-creative" use cases.

    Model is set with Qwen's default config:

        40 k context
        8 of 64 experts activated.
        Chatml OR Jinja Template (embedded)

    Four example generations below.

    IMPORTANT:

    See usage guide / repo below to get the most out of this model, as settings are very specific.

    If not set correctly, this model will not work the way it should.

    Critical settings:

        Chatml or Jinja Template (embedded, but updated version at repo below)
        Rep pen of 1.01 or 1.02 ; higher (1.04, 1.05) will result in "Harley Mode".
        Temp range of .6 to 1.2. ; higher you may need to prompt the model to "output" after thinking.
        Experts set at 8-10 ; higher will result in "odder" output BUT it might be better.

    That being said, "Harley Quinn" may make her presence known at any moment.

    USAGE GUIDE:

    Please refer to this model card for

        Specific usage, suggested settings, changing ACTIVE EXPERTS, templates, settings and the like:
        How to maximize this model in "uncensored" form, with specific notes on "abliterated" models.

    KNOWN ISSUES:

        Model may add extra space from time to time before a word.
        Incorrect template and/or settings will result in a drop in performance / poor performance.
        Can rant at the end / repeat. Most of the time it will stop on its own.

    Looking for the Abliterated / Uncensored version?

    https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-23B-A3B-The-Harley-Quinn-PUDDIN-Abliterated-Uncensored

    In some cases this "abliterated/uncensored" version may work better than this version.
    EXAMPLES

    Standard system prompt, rep pen 1.01-1.02, topk 100, topp .95, minp .05, rep pen range 64.

    Tested in LMStudio, quant Q4KS, GPU (CPU output will differ slightly).

    As this is the mid range quant, expected better results from higher quants and/or with more experts activated to be better.

    NOTE: Some formatting lost on copy/paste.

    Zhi-Create-Qwen3-32B is a fine-tuned model derived from Qwen/Qwen3-32B, with a focus on enhancing creative writing capabilities. Through careful optimization, the model shows promising improvements in creative writing performance, as evaluated using the WritingBench. In our evaluation, the model attains a score of 82.08 on WritingBench, which represents a significant improvement over the base Qwen3-32B model's score of 78.97.

    Additionally, to maintain the model's general capabilities such as knowledge and reasoning, we performed fine-grained data mixture experiments by combining general knowledge, mathematics, code, and other data types. The final evaluation results show that general capabilities remain stable with no significant decline compared to the base model.

    Hermes 4 14B is a frontier, hybrid-mode reasoning model based on Qwen 3 14B by Nous Research that is aligned to you.

    Read the Hermes 4 technical report here: Hermes 4 Technical Report

    Chat with Hermes in Nous Chat: https://chat.nousresearch.com

    Training highlights include a newly synthesized post-training corpus emphasizing verified reasoning traces, massive improvements in math, code, STEM, logic, creativity, and format-faithful outputs, while preserving general assistant quality and broadly neutral alignment.
    What’s new vs Hermes 3

        Post-training corpus: Massively increased dataset size from 1M samples and 1.2B tokens to ~5M samples / ~60B tokens blended across reasoning and non-reasoning data.
        Hybrid reasoning mode with explicit <think>…</think> segments when the model decides to deliberate, and options to make your responses faster when you want.
        Reasoning that is top quality, expressive, improves math, code, STEM, logic, and even creative writing and subjective responses.
        Schema adherence & structured outputs: trained to produce valid JSON for given schemas and to repair malformed objects.
        Much easier to steer and align: extreme improvements on steerability, especially on reduced refusal rates.

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    This model is specifically for SG1 (Stargate Series), science fiction, story generation (all genres) but also does coding and general tasks too.

    This model can also be used for Role play.

    This model will produce uncensored content (see notes below).

    Fine tune (6 epochs, using Unsloth for Win 11) on an inhouse generated dataset to simulate / explore the Stargate SG1 Universe.

    This version has the "canon" of all 10 seasons of SG1.

    Model also contains, but not trained, on content from Stargate Atlantis, and Universe.

    Fine tune process adds knowledge to the model, and alter all aspects of its operations.

    Float32 (32 bit precision) was used to further increase the model's quality.

    This model is based on "Goekdeniz-Guelmez/Josiefied-Qwen3-8B-abliterated-v1".

    Example generations at the bottom of this page.

    This is a Stargate (SG1) fine tune (1,331,953,664 of 9,522,689,024 (13.99% trained)), SIX epochs on this model.
    As this is an instruct model, it will also benefit from a detailed system prompt too.

    Just a sneak peek of what I'm cooking in a little project called Vellum. This model was made to evaluate the quality of the CreativeGPT dataset, and how well Qwen3 trains on it. This is just one of many datasets that the final model will be trained on (which will also be using a different base model).

    This got pretty good results compared to the regular instruct in my testing so thought I would share. I trained for 3 epochs, but both checkpoints at 2 epoch and 3 epoch were too overbaked. This checkpoint, at 1 epoch performed best.

    I'm pretty surprised how decent this came out since Qwen models aren't that great at writing, especially at this size.

    google/gemma-3-1b-it is a large language model with 1 billion parameters. It is part of the Gemma family of open, state-of-the-art models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Gemma 3 models are multimodal, handling text and image input and generating text output, with open weights for both pre-trained variants and instruction-tuned variants. These models have multilingual support in over 140 languages, and are available in more sizes than previous versions. They are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.

    This model corresponds to the 12B instruction-tuned version of the Gemma 3 model in GGUF format using Quantization Aware Training (QAT). The GGUF corresponds to Q4_0 quantization.

    Thanks to QAT, the model is able to preserve similar quality as bfloat16 while significantly reducing the memory requirements to load the model.

    You can find the half-precision version here.

    This is a pre-alpha proof-of-concept of a real fully uncensored vision model.

    Why do I say "real"? The few vision models we got (qwen, llama 3.2) were "censored," and their fine-tunes were made only to the text portion of the model, as training a vision model is a serious pain.

    The only actually trained and uncensored vision model I am aware of is ToriiGate; the rest of the vision models are just the stock vision + a fine-tuned LLM.

    A creative writing model based on a merge of fine-tunes on Gemma 3 12B IT and Gemma 3 12B PT.

    This is the Story Focused merge. This version works better for storytelling and scenarios, as the prose is more novel-like and it has a tendency to impersonate the user character.

    See the Alternate RP Focused version as well.

    This is a merge of two G3 models, one trained on instruct and one trained on base:

        allura-org/Gemma-3-Glitter-12B - Itself a merge of a storywriting and RP train (both also by ToastyPigeon), on instruct
        ToastyPigeon/Gemma-3-Confetti-12B - Experimental application of the Glitter data using base instead of instruct, additionally includes some adventure data in the form of SpringDragon.

    The result is a lovely blend of Glitter's ability to follow instructions and Confetti's free-spirit prose, effectively 'loosening up' much of the hesitancy that was left in Glitter.

    This is a requantized version of https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-27b-it-qat-q4_0-gguf. The official QAT weights released by google use fp16 (instead of Q6_K) for the embeddings table, which makes this model take a significant extra amount of memory (and storage) compared to what Q4_0 quants are supposed to take. Requantizing with llama.cpp achieves a very similar result. Note that this model ends up smaller than the Q4_0 from Bartowski. This is because llama.cpp sets some tensors to Q4_1 when quantizing models to Q4_0 with imatrix, but this is a static quant. The perplexity score for this one is even lower with this model compared to the original model by Google, but the results are within margin of error, so it's probably just luck. I also fixed the control token metadata, which was slightly degrading the performance of the model in instruct mode.

    This is a merge of pre-trained gemma3 language models
    Goal of this merge was to create good uncensored gemma 3 model good for assistant and roleplay, with uncensored vision.
    First, vision: i dont know is it normal, but it slightly hallucinate (maybe q3 is too low?), but lack any refusals and otherwise work fine. I used default gemma 3 27b mmproj.
    Second, text: it is slow on my hardware, slower than 24b mistral, speed close to 32b QWQ. Model is smart even on q3, responses are adequate in length and are interesting to read. Model is quite attentive to context, tested up to 8k - no problems or degradation spotted. (beware of your typos, it will copy yours mistakes) Creative capabilities are good too, model will create good plot for you, if you let it. Model follows instructions fine, it is really good in "adventure" type of cards. Russian is supported, is not too great, maybe on higher quants is better. Refusals was not encountered.
    However, i find this model not unbiased enough. It is close to neutrality, but i want it more "dark". Positivity highly depends on prompts. With good enough cards model can do wonders.
    Tested on Q3_K_L, t 1.04.

    This model is an experiment to try to produce a strong smaller thinking model capable of fitting in an 8GiB consumer graphics card with generalizeable reasoning capabilities. Most other open source thinking models, especially on the smaller side, fail to generalize their reasoning to tasks other than coding or math due to an overly large focus on GRPO zero for CoT which is only applicable for coding and math.

    Instead of using GRPO, this model aims to SFT a wide variety of high quality, diverse reasoning traces from Deepseek R1 onto Gemma 3 to force the model to learn to effectively generalize its reasoning capabilites to a large number of tasks as an extension of the LiMO paper's approach to Math/Coding CoT. A subset of V3 O3/24 non-thinking data was also included for improved creativity and to allow the model to retain it's non-thinking capabilites.

    Training off the QAT checkpoint allows for this model to be used without a drop in quality at Q4_0, requiring only ~6GiB of memory.
    Thinking Mode

    Similar to the Qwen 3 model line, Gemma Fornax can be used with or without thinking mode enabled.

        To enable thinking place /think in the system prompt and prefill <think>\n for thinking mode.

        To disable thinking put /no_think in the system prompt.

    MedGemma is a collection of Gemma 3 variants that are trained for performance on medical text and image comprehension. Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building healthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma currently comes in two variants: a 4B multimodal version and a 27B text-only version.

    MedGemma 4B utilizes a SigLIP image encoder that has been specifically pre-trained on a variety of de-identified medical data, including chest X-rays, dermatology images, ophthalmology images, and histopathology slides. Its LLM component is trained on a diverse set of medical data, including radiology images, histopathology patches, ophthalmology images, and dermatology images.

    MedGemma 4B is available in both pre-trained (suffix: -pt) and instruction-tuned (suffix -it) versions. The instruction-tuned version is a better starting point for most applications. The pre-trained version is available for those who want to experiment more deeply with the models.

    MedGemma 27B has been trained exclusively on medical text and optimized for inference-time computation. MedGemma 27B is only available as an instruction-tuned model.

    MedGemma variants have been evaluated on a range of clinically relevant benchmarks to illustrate their baseline performance. These include both open benchmark datasets and curated datasets. Developers can fine-tune MedGemma variants for improved performance. Consult the Intended Use section below for more details.

    MedGemma is a collection of Gemma 3 variants that are trained for performance on medical text and image comprehension. Developers can use MedGemma to accelerate building healthcare-based AI applications. MedGemma currently comes in two variants: a 4B multimodal version and a 27B text-only version.

    MedGemma 4B utilizes a SigLIP image encoder that has been specifically pre-trained on a variety of de-identified medical data, including chest X-rays, dermatology images, ophthalmology images, and histopathology slides. Its LLM component is trained on a diverse set of medical data, including radiology images, histopathology patches, ophthalmology images, and dermatology images.

    MedGemma 4B is available in both pre-trained (suffix: -pt) and instruction-tuned (suffix -it) versions. The instruction-tuned version is a better starting point for most applications. The pre-trained version is available for those who want to experiment more deeply with the models.

    MedGemma 27B has been trained exclusively on medical text and optimized for inference-time computation. MedGemma 27B is only available as an instruction-tuned model.

    MedGemma variants have been evaluated on a range of clinically relevant benchmarks to illustrate their baseline performance. These include both open benchmark datasets and curated datasets. Developers can fine-tune MedGemma variants for improved performance. Consult the Intended Use section below for more details.

    Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Gemma 3n models are designed for efficient execution on low-resource devices. They are capable of multimodal input, handling text, image, video, and audio input, and generating text outputs, with open weights for pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. These models were trained with data in over 140 spoken languages.
    Gemma 3n models use selective parameter activation technology to reduce resource requirements. This technique allows the models to operate at an effective size of 2B and 4B parameters, which is lower than the total number of parameters they contain. For more information on Gemma 3n's efficient parameter management technology, see the Gemma 3n page.

  description: |
    Google's newest Gemma-3 model that has been uncensored by David_AU (maintains instruction following / model performance and adds 4 layers to the model) and re-enforced with a system prompt (optional) - see below.
    The "Horror Imatrix" was built using Grand Horror 16B (at my repo). This adds a "tint" of horror to the model.

    5 examples provided (NSFW / F-Bombs galore) below with prompts at IQ4XS (56 t/s on mid level card).

    Context: 128k.

    "MAXED"

    This means the embed and output tensor are set at "BF16" (full precision) for all quants. This enhances quality, depth and general performance at the cost of a slightly larger quant.

    "HORROR IMATRIX"

    A strong, in house built, imatrix dataset built by David_AU which results in better overall function, instruction following, output quality and stronger connections to ideas, concepts and the world in general.

    This combines with "MAXing" the quant to improve preformance.

    This is an uncensored version of google/gemma-3n-E4B-it created with abliteration (see remove-refusals-with-transformers to know more about it). This is a crude, proof-of-concept implementation to remove refusals from an LLM model without using TransformerLens.

    It was only the text part that was processed, not the image part. After abliterated, it seems like more output content has been opened from a magic box.

    MedGemma is optimized for medical applications that involve a text generation component. For medical image-based applications that do not involve text generation, such as data-efficient classification, zero-shot classification, or content-based or semantic image retrieval, the MedSigLIP image encoder is recommended. MedSigLIP is based on the same image encoder that powers MedGemma.

    Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. Gemma 3 models are multimodal, handling text and image input and generating text output, with open weights for both pre-trained variants and instruction-tuned variants. Gemma 3 has a large, 128K context window, multilingual support in over 140 languages, and is available in more sizes than previous versions. Gemma 3 models are well-suited for a variety of text generation and image understanding tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as laptops, desktops or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.
    This model is a QAT (Quantization Aware Training) version of the Gemma 3 270M model. It is quantized to 4-bit precision, which means that it uses 4-bit floating point numbers to represent the weights and activations of the model. This reduces the memory footprint of the model and makes it faster to run on GPUs.

    Unlike our previous EEVE models, this model does not feature an expanded tokenizer. Base Model: google/gemma-3-12b-pt
    This model is a 12-billion parameter, decoder-only language model built on the Gemma3 architecture and fine-tuned by Yanolja NEXT. It is specifically designed to translate structured data (JSON format) while preserving the original data structure.
    The model was trained on a multilingual dataset covering the following languages equally:
    Arabic
    Bulgarian
    Chinese
    Czech
    Danish
    Dutch
    English
    Finnish
    French
    German
    Greek
    Gujarati
    Hebrew
    Hindi
    Hungarian
    Indonesian
    Italian
    Japanese
    Korean

    Romanian
    Russian
    Slovak
    Spanish
    Swedish
    Tagalog
    Thai
    Turkish
    Ukrainian
    Vietnamese
    While optimized for these languages, it may also perform effectively on other languages supported by the base Gemma3 model.

    - The BEST Phi-4 Roleplay finetune in the world (Not that much of an achievement here, Phi roleplay  finetunes can probably be counted on a single hand).
    - Compact size & fully healed from the brain surgery Only 11.9B parameters. Phi-4 wasn't that hard to run even at 14B, now with even fewer brain cells, your new phone could probably run it easily. (SD8Gen3 and above recommended).
    - Strong Roleplay & Creative writing abilities. This really surprised me. Actually good.
    Writes and roleplays quite uniquely, probably because of lack of RP\writing slop in the pretrain. Who would have thought?
    - Smart assistant with low refusals - It kept some of the smarts, and our little Phi-Lthy here will be quite eager to answer your naughty questions.
    - Quite good at following the character card. Finally, it puts its math brain to some productive tasks. Gooner technology is becoming more popular by the day.

    Excellent Roleplay with more brains. (Who would have thought Phi-4 models would be good at this? so weird... )
    Medium length response (1-4 paragraphs, usually 2-3).
    Excellent assistant that follows instructions well enough, and keeps good formating.
    Strong Creative writing abilities. Will obey requests regarding formatting (markdown headlines for paragraphs, etc).
    Writes and roleplays quite uniquely, probably because of lack of RP\writing slop in the pretrain. This is just my guesstimate.
    LOW refusals - Total freedom in RP, can do things other RP models won't, and I'll leave it at that. Low refusals in assistant tasks as well.
    VERY good at following the character card. Math brain is used for gooner tech, as it should be.

    Phi-4-mini-reasoning is a lightweight open model built upon synthetic data with a focus on high-quality, reasoning dense data further finetuned for more advanced math reasoning capabilities. The model belongs to the Phi-4 model family and supports 128K token context length.
    Phi-4-mini-reasoning is designed for multi-step, logic-intensive mathematical problem-solving tasks under memory/compute constrained environments and latency bound scenarios. Some of the use cases include formal proof generation, symbolic computation, advanced word problems, and a wide range of mathematical reasoning scenarios. These models excel at maintaining context across steps, applying structured logic, and delivering accurate, reliable solutions in domains that require deep analytical thinking.
    This model is designed and tested for math reasoning only. It is not specifically designed or evaluated for all downstream purposes. Developers should consider common limitations of language models, as well as performance difference across languages, as they select use cases, and evaluate and mitigate for accuracy, safety, and fairness before using within a specific downstream use case, particularly for high-risk scenarios. Developers should be aware of and adhere to applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to privacy, trade compliance laws, etc.) that are relevant to their use case.
    Nothing contained in this Model Card should be interpreted as or deemed a restriction or modification to the license the model is released under.
    This release of Phi-4-mini-reasoning addresses user feedback and market demand for a compact reasoning model. It is a compact transformer-based language model optimized for mathematical reasoning, built to deliver high-quality, step-by-step problem solving in environments where computing or latency is constrained. The model is fine-tuned with synthetic math data from a more capable model (much larger, smarter, more accurate, and better at following instructions), which has resulted in enhanced reasoning performance. Phi-4-mini-reasoning balances reasoning ability with efficiency, making it potentially suitable for educational applications, embedded tutoring, and lightweight deployment on edge or mobile systems. If a critical issue is identified with Phi-4-mini-reasoning, it should be promptly reported through the MSRC Researcher Portal or secure@microsoft.com

    Maestro-10B is a 10 billion parameter model fine-tuned from Virtuoso-Lite, a next-generation language model developed by arcee-ai. Virtuoso-Lite itself is based on the Llama-3 architecture, distilled from Deepseek-v3 using approximately 1.1 billion tokens/logits. This distillation process allows Virtuoso-Lite to achieve robust performance with a smaller parameter count, excelling in reasoning, code generation, and mathematical problem-solving. Maestro-10B inherits these strengths from its base model, Virtuoso-Lite, and further enhances them through fine-tuning on the OpenOrca dataset. This combination of a distilled base model and targeted fine-tuning makes Maestro-10B a powerful and efficient language model.

    INTELLECT-1 is the first collaboratively trained 10 billion parameter language model trained from scratch on 1 trillion tokens of English text and code.
    This is an instruct model. The base model associated with it is INTELLECT-1.
    INTELLECT-1 was trained on up to 14 concurrent nodes distributed across 3 continents, with contributions from 30 independent community contributors providing compute. The training code utilizes the prime framework, a scalable distributed training framework designed for fault-tolerant, dynamically scaling, high-perfomance training on unreliable, globally distributed workers. The key abstraction that allows dynamic scaling is the ElasticDeviceMesh which manages dynamic global process groups for fault-tolerant communication across the internet and local process groups for communication within a node. The model was trained using the DiLoCo algorithms with 100 inner steps. The global all-reduce was done with custom int8 all-reduce kernels to reduce the communication payload required, greatly reducing the communication overhead by a factor 400x.

    It's a very balanced model between the L3.3 tunes. It's very creative, able to come up with new and interesting scenarios on your own that will thoroughly surprise you in ways that remind me of a 123B model. It has some of the most natural sounding dialogue and prose can come out of any model I've tried with the right swipe, in a way that truly brings your characters and RP to life that makes you feel like you're talking to a human writer instead of an AI - a quality that reminds me of Character AI in its prime. This model loves a great prompt and thrives off instructions.

    Enjoyed SicariusSicariiStuff/Negative_LLAMA_70B but the prose was too dry for my tastes. So I merged it with TheDrummer/Anubis-70B-v1 for verbosity. Anubis has positivity bias so Negative could balance things out.

    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.

    The following models were included in the merge:

    This model was created as I liked the storytelling of EVA, the prose and details of scenes from EURYALE and Anubis, enhanced with Negative_LLAMA to kill off the positive bias with a touch of nemotron sprinkeled in.

    The choice to use the lorablated model as a base was intentional - while it might seem counterintuitive, this approach creates unique interactions between the weights, similar to what was achieved in the original Astoria model and Astoria V2 model . Rather than simply removing refusals, this "weight twisting" effect that occurs when subtracting the lorablated base model from the other models during the merge process creates an interesting balance in the final model's behavior. While this approach differs from traditional sequential application of components, it was chosen for its unique characteristics in the model's responses.

    The Magnum v4 series is complete, but here's something a little extra I wanted to tack on as I wasn't entirely satisfied with the results of v4 72B. "SE" for Special Edition - this model is finetuned from meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct as an rsLoRA adapter. The dataset is a slightly revised variant of the v4 data with some elements of the v2 data re-introduced.

    The objective, as with the other Magnum models, is to emulate the prose style and quality of the Claude 3 Sonnet/Opus series of models on a local scale, so don't be surprised to see "Claude-isms" in its output.

    A merge of some Llama 3.3 models because um uh yeah

    Went extra schizo on the recipe, hoping for an extra fun result, and... Well, I guess it's an overall improvement over the previous revision. It's a tiny bit smarter, has even more distinct swipes and nice dialogues, but for some reason it's damn sloppy.

    I've published the second step of this merge as a separate model, and I'd say the results are more interesting, but not as usable as this one. https://huggingface.co/Nohobby/AbominationSnowPig

  description: |
    This model builds upon the original Nevoria foundation, incorporating the Deepseek-R1 reasoning architecture to enhance dialogue interaction and scene comprehension. While maintaining Nevoria's core strengths in storytelling and scene description (derived from EVA, EURYALE, and Anubis), this iteration aims to improve prompt adherence and creative reasoning capabilities. The model also retains the balanced perspective introduced by Negative_LLAMA and Nemotron elements. Also, the model plays the card to almost a fault, It'll pick up on minor issues and attempt to run with them. Users had it call them out for misspelling a word while playing in character.

    Note: While Nevoria-R1 represents a significant architectural change, rather than a direct successor to Nevoria, it operates as a distinct model with its own characteristics.

    The lorablated model base choice was intentional, creating unique weight interactions similar to the original Astoria model and Astoria V2 model. This "weight twisting" effect, achieved by subtracting the lorablated base model during merging, creates an interesting balance in the model's behavior. While unconventional compared to sequential component application, this approach was chosen for its unique response characteristics.

    Cu-Mai, a play on San-Mai for Copper-Steel Damascus, represents a significant evolution in the three-part model series alongside San-Mai (OG) and Mokume-Gane. While maintaining the grounded and reliable nature of San-Mai, Cu-Mai introduces its own distinct "flavor" in terms of prose and overall vibe. The model demonstrates strong adherence to prompts while offering a unique creative expression.
    L3.3-Cu-Mai-R1-70b integrates specialized components through the SCE merge method:

    EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
    Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
    Anubis components for detailed scene description
    Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Users consistently praise Cu-Mai for its:

        Exceptional prose quality and natural dialogue flow
        Strong adherence to prompts and creative expression
        Improved coherency and reduced repetition
        Performance on par with the original model

    While some users note slightly reduced intelligence compared to the original, this trade-off is generally viewed as minimal and doesn't significantly impact the overall experience. The model's reasoning capabilities can be effectively activated through proper prompting techniques.

    After banging my head against the wall some more - I actually managed to merge DeepSeek distill into my mess! Along with even more models (my hand just slipped, I swear)

    The prose is better than in v0.5, but has a different feel to it, so I guess it's more of a step to the side than forward (hence the title EXTRA instead of 0.6).

    The context recall may have improved, or I'm just gaslighting myself to think so.

    And of course, since it now has DeepSeek in it - <think> tags!

    They kinda work out of the box if you add <think> to the 'Start Reply With' field in ST - that way the model will write a really short character thought in it. However, if we want some OOC reasoning, things get trickier.

    My initial thought was that this model could be instructed to use <think> either only for {{char}}'s inner monologue or for detached analysis, but actually it would end up writing character thoughts most of the time anyway, and the times when it did reason stuff it threw the narrative out of the window by making it too formal and even adding some notes at the end.

    We’ve heard over and over from AI Dungeon players that modern AI models are too nice, never letting them fail or die. While it may be good for a chatbot to be nice and helpful, great stories and games aren’t all rainbows and unicorns. They have conflict, tension, and even death. These create real stakes and consequences for characters and the journeys they go on.

    Similarly, great games need opposition. You must be able to fail, die, and may even have to start over. This makes games more fun!

    However, the vast majority of AI models, through alignment RLHF, have been trained away from darkness, violence, or conflict, preventing them from fulfilling this role. To give our players better options, we decided to train our own model to fix these issues.

    The Wayfarer model series are a set of adventure role-play models specifically trained to give players a challenging and dangerous experience.

    We wanted to contribute back to the open source community that we’ve benefitted so much from so we open sourced a 12b parameter version version back in Jan. We thought people would love it but people were even more excited than we expected.

    Due to popular request we decided to train a larger 70b version based on Llama 3.3.

    New merge. This an experiment to increase the "Madness" in a model. Merge is based on top UGI-Bench models (So yeah, I would think this would be benchmaxxing.)

    This is the second time I'm using SCE. The previous MagicalGirl model seems to be quite happy with it.

    Added KaraKaraWitch/Llama-MiraiFanfare-3.3-70B based on feedback I got from others (People generally seem to remember this rather than other models). So I'm not sure how this would play into the merge.
    The following models were included in the merge:

    L3.3-Electra-R1-70b is the newest release of the Unnamed series, this is the 6th iteration based of user feedback.
    Built on a custom DeepSeek R1 Distill base (TheSkullery/L3.1x3.3-Hydroblated-R1-70B-v4.4), Electra-R1 integrates specialized components through the SCE merge method. The model uses float32 dtype during processing with a bfloat16 output dtype for optimized performance.
    Electra-R1 serves newest gold standard and baseline. User feedback consistently highlights its superior intelligence, coherence, and unique ability to provide deep character insights. Through proper prompting, the model demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities and unprompted exploration of character inner thoughts and motivations.
    The model utilizes the custom Hydroblated-R1 base, created for stability and enhanced reasoning. The SCE merge method's settings are precisely tuned based on extensive community feedback (of over 10 diffrent models from Nevoria to Cu-Mai), ensuring optimal component integration while maintaining model coherence and reliability. This foundation establishes Electra-R1 as the benchmark upon which its variant models build and expand.

  description: |
    Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1 is a large language model (LLM) which is a derivative of Meta Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (AKA the reference model). It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling. The model supports a context length of 128K tokens.

    Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. Efficiency (throughput) directly translates to savings. Using a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach, we greatly reduce the model’s memory footprint, enabling larger workloads, as well as fitting the model on a single GPU at high workloads (H200). This NAS approach enables the selection of a desired point in the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff.

    The model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using REINFORCE (RLOO) and Online Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) algorithms for both chat and instruction-following. The final model checkpoint is obtained after merging the final SFT and Online RPO checkpoints. For more details on how the model was trained, please see this blog.

    My biggest merge yet, consisting of a total of 20 specially curated models. My methodology in approaching this was to create 5 highly specialized models:

    A completely uncensored base A very intelligent model based on UGI, Willingness and NatInt scores on the UGI Leaderboard A highly descriptive writing model, specializing in creative and natural prose A RP model specially merged with fine-tuned models that use a lot of RP datasets The secret ingredient: A completely unhinged, uncensored final model

    These five models went through a series of iterations until I got something I thought worked well and then combined them to make LEGION.

    The Cogito LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.

        Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
        The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
        The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
            In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
        Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    Dark coloration L3.3 merge, to be included in my merges. Can also be tried as a standalone to have a darker Llama Experience, but I didn't take the time.
    Edit : I took the time, and it meets its purpose.

        It's average on the basic metrics (smarts, perplexity), but it's not woke and unhinged indeed.
        The model is not abliterated, though. It has refusals on the usual point-blank questions.
        I will play with it more, because it has potential.

    My note : 3/5 as a standalone. 4/5 as a merge brick.

    Warning : this model can be brutal and vulgar, more than most of my previous merges.

    An experimental release.

    zerofata/GeneticLemonade-Unleashed qlora trained on a test dataset. Performance is improved from the original in my testing, but there are possibly (likely?) areas where the model will underperform which I am looking for feedback on.

    This is a creative model intended to excel at character driven RP / ERP. It has not been tested or trained on adventure stories or any large amounts of creative writing.

    Inspired to learn how to merge by the Nevoria series from SteelSkull.

    I wasn't planning to release any more models in this series, but I wasn't fully satisfied with Unleashed or the Final version. I happened upon the below when testing merges and found myself coming back to it, so decided to publish.
    Model Comparison

    Designed for RP and creative writing, all three models are focused around striking a balance between writing style, creativity and intelligence.

    it swears unprompted 10/10 model

    ... characters work well, groups work well, scenarios also work really well so great model overall

    This is pretty exciting though. GLM-4 already had me on the verge of deleting all of my other 32b and lower models. I got to test this more but I think this model at Q3m is the death blow lol

    Smart Nemotron 49b learned how to roleplay

    Even without thinking it rock solid at 4qm.

    Without thinking is like 40-70b level. With thinking is 100+b level

    This model would have been AGI if it were named properly with a name like "Bob". Alas, it was not.

    I think this model is nice. It follows prompts very well. I didn't really note any major issues or repetition

    Yeah this is good. I think its clearly smart enough, close to the other L3.3 70b models. It follows directions and formatting very well. I asked it to create the intro message, my first response was formatted differently, and it immediately followed my format on the second message. I also have max tokens at 2k cause I like the model to finish it's thought. But I started trimming the models responses when I felt the last bit was unnecessary and it started replying closer to that length. It's pretty much uncensored.

    Nemotron is my favorite model, and I think you fixed it!!

    This checkpoint was finetuned with a process I'm calling "Elarablation" (a portamenteau of "Elara", which is a name that shows up in AI-generated writing and RP all the time) and "ablation". The idea is to reduce the amount of repetitiveness and "slop" that the model exhibits. In addition to significantly reducing the occurrence of the name "Elara", I've also reduced other very common names that pop up in certain situations. I've also specifically attacked two phrases, "voice barely above a whisper" and "eyes glinted with mischief", which come up a lot less often now. Finally, I've convinced it that it can put a f-cking period after the word "said" because a lot of slop-ish phrases tend to come after "said,".

    You can check out some of the more technical details in the overview on my github repo, here:

    https://github.com/envy-ai/elarablate

    My current focus has been on some of the absolute worst offending phrases in AI creative writing, but I plan to go after RP slop as well. If you run into any issues with this model (going off the rails, repeating tokens, etc), go to the community tab and post the context and parameters in a comment so I can look into it. Also, if you have any "slop" pet peeves, post the context of those as well and I can try to reduce/eliminate them in the next version.

    The settings I've tested with are temperature at 0.7 and all other filters completely neutral. Other settings may lead to better or worse results.

    L3.3-Shakudo-70b is the result of a multi-stage merging process by Steelskull, designed to create a powerful and creative roleplaying model with a unique flavor. The creation process involved several advanced merging techniques, including weight twisting, to achieve its distinct characteristics.
    Stage 1: The Cognitive Foundation & Weight Twisting

    The process began by creating a cognitive and tool-use focused base model, L3.3-Cogmoblated-70B. This was achieved through a `model_stock` merge of several models known for their reasoning and instruction-following capabilities. This base was built upon `nbeerbower/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-lorablated-70B`, a model intentionally "ablated" to skew refusal behaviors. This technique, known as weight twisting, helps the final model adopt more desirable response patterns by building upon a foundation that is already aligned against common refusal patterns.
    Stage 2: The Twin Hydrargyrum - Flavor and Depth

    Two distinct models were then created from the Cogmoblated base:

        L3.3-M1-Hydrargyrum-70B: This model was merged using `SCE`, a technique that enhances creative writing and prose style, giving the model its unique "flavor." The Top_K for this merge were set at 0.22 .
        L3.3-M2-Hydrargyrum-70B: This model was created using a `Della_Linear` merge, which focuses on integrating the "depth" of various roleplaying and narrative models. The settings for this merge were set at: (lambda: 1.1) (weight: 0.2) (density: 0.7) (epsilon: 0.2)

    Final Stage: Shakudo

    The final model, L3.3-Shakudo-70b, was created by merging the two Hydrargyrum variants using a 50/50 `nuslerp`. This final step combines the rich, creative prose (flavor) from the SCE merge with the strong roleplaying capabilities (depth) from the Della_Linear merge, resulting in a model with a distinct and refined narrative voice.

    A special thank you to Nectar.ai for their generous support of the open-source community and my projects.

    Additionally, a heartfelt thanks to all the Ko-fi supporters who have contributed—your generosity is deeply appreciated and helps keep this work going and the Pods spinning.

    Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-GenRM-Multilingual can be used to judge the quality of one response, or the ranking between two responses given a multilingual conversation history. It will first generate reasoning traces then output an integer score. A higher score means the response is of higher quality.

    Skywork-SWE-32B is a code agent model developed by Skywork AI, specifically designed for software engineering (SWE) tasks. It demonstrates strong performance across several key metrics:

    Skywork-SWE-32B attains 38.0% pass@1 accuracy on the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, outperforming previous open-source SoTA Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-based LLMs built on the OpenHands agent framework.
    When incorporated with test-time scaling techniques, the performance further improves to 47.0% accuracy, surpassing the previous SoTA results for sub-32B parameter models.
    We clearly demonstrate the data scaling law phenomenon for software engineering capabilities in LLMs, with no signs of saturation at 8209 collected training trajectories.

    We also introduce an efficient and automated pipeline for SWE data collection, culminating in the creation of the Skywork-SWE dataset---a large-scale, high-quality dataset featuring comprehensive executable runtime environments. Detailed descriptions are available on our technical report.

    Granite 3.0 language models are a new set of lightweight state-of-the-art, open foundation models that natively support multilinguality, coding, reasoning, and tool usage, including the potential to be run on constrained compute resources. All the models are publicly released under an Apache 2.0 license for both research and commercial use. The models' data curation and training procedure were designed for enterprise usage and customization in mind, with a process that evaluates datasets for governance, risk and compliance (GRC) criteria, in addition to IBM's standard data clearance process and document quality checks.
    Granite 3.0 includes 4 different models of varying sizes:
        Dense Models: 2B and 8B parameter models, trained on 12 trillion tokens in total.
        Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) Models: Sparse 1B and 3B MoE models, with 400M and 800M activated parameters respectively, trained on 10 trillion tokens in total.
    Accordingly, these options provide a range of models with different compute requirements to choose from, with appropriate trade-offs with their performance on downstream tasks. At each scale, we release a base model — checkpoints of models after pretraining, as well as instruct checkpoints — models finetuned for dialogue, instruction-following, helpfulness, and safety.

  description: |
    A roleplay-centric finetune of IBM's Granite 3.0 3B-A800M. LoRA finetune trained locally, whereas the others were FFT; while this results in less uptake of training data, it should also mean less degradation in Granite's core abilities, making it potentially easier to use for general-purpose tasks.
    Disclaimer

    PLEASE do not expect godliness out of this, it's a model with 800 million active parameters. Expect something more akin to GPT-3 (the original, not GPT-3.5.) (Furthermore, this version is by a less experienced tuner; it's my first finetune that actually has decent-looking graphs, I don't really know what I'm doing yet!)

  description: |
    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

  description: |
    DeepHermes 3 Preview is the latest version of our flagship Hermes series of LLMs by Nous Research, and one of the first models in the world to unify Reasoning (long chains of thought that improve answer accuracy) and normal LLM response modes into one model. We have also improved LLM annotation, judgement, and function calling.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is a hybrid reasoning model, and one of the first LLM models to unify both "intuitive", traditional mode responses and long chain of thought reasoning responses into a single model, toggled by a system prompt.

    Hermes 3, the predecessor of DeepHermes 3, is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

    The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

    This is a preview Hermes with early reasoning capabilities, distilled from R1 across a variety of tasks that benefit from reasoning and objectivity. Some quirks may be discovered! Please let us know any interesting findings or issues you discover!

    I wanted to create a model with an exceptional capacity for using varied speech patterns and fresh role-play takes. The model had to have a unique personality, not on a surface level but on the inside, for real. Unfortunately, SFT alone just didn't cut it. And I had only 16GB of VRAM at the time. Oh, and I wanted it to be small enough to be viable for phones and to be able to give a fight to larger models while at it. If only there was a magical way to do it.

    Merges. Merges are quite unique. In the early days, they were considered "fake." Clearly, there's no such thing as merges. Where are the papers? No papers? Then it's clearly impossible. "Mathematically impossible." Simply preposterous. To mix layers and hope for a coherent output? What nonsense!

    And yet, they were real. Undi95 made some of the earliest merges I can remember, and the "LLAMA2 Era" was truly amazing and innovative thanks to them. Cool stuff like Tiefighter was being made, and eventually the time tested Midnight-Miqu-70B (v1.5 is my personal favorite).

    Merges are an interesting thing, as they affect LLMs in a way that is currently impossible to reproduce using SFT (or any 'SOTA' technique). One of the plagues we have today, while we have orders of magnitude smarter LLMs, is GPTisms and predictability. Merges can potentially 'solve' that. How? In short, if you physically tear neurons (passthrough brain surgery) while you somehow manage to keep the model coherent enough, and if you're lucky, it can even follows instructions- then magical stuff begins to happen.

    The Cogito LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.

    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    ReZero trains a small language model to develop effective search behaviors instead of memorizing static data. It interacts with multiple synthetic search engines, each with unique retrieval mechanisms, to refine queries and persist in searching until it finds exact answers. The project focuses on reinforcement learning, preventing overfitting, and optimizing for efficiency in real-world search applications.

    It's the 10th of May, 2025—lots of progress is being made in the world of AI (DeepSeek, Qwen, etc...)—but still, there has yet to be a fully coherent 1B RP model. Why?

    Well, at 1B size, the mere fact a model is even coherent is some kind of a marvel—and getting it to roleplay feels like you're asking too much from 1B parameters. Making very small yet smart models is quite hard, making one that does RP is exceedingly hard. I should know.

    I've made the world's first 3B roleplay model—Impish_LLAMA_3B—and I thought that this was the absolute minimum size for coherency and RP capabilities. I was wrong.

    One of my stated goals was to make AI accessible and available for everyone—but not everyone could run 13B or even 8B models. Some people only have mid-tier phones, should they be left behind?

    A growing sentiment often says something along the lines of:

        If your waifu runs on someone else's hardware—then she's not your waifu.

    I'm not an expert in waifu culture, but I do agree that people should be able to run models locally, without their data (knowingly or unknowingly) being used for X or Y.

    I thought my goal of making a roleplay model that everyone could run would only be realized sometime in the future—when mid-tier phones got the equivalent of a high-end Snapdragon chipset. Again I was wrong, as this changes today.

    Today, the 10th of May 2025, I proudly present to you—Nano_Imp_1B, the world's first and only fully coherent 1B-parameter roleplay model.

    In August 2024, we released the first series of mathematical LLMs - Qwen2-Math - of our Qwen family. A month later, we have upgraded it and open-sourced Qwen2.5-Math series, including base models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B, instruction-tuned models Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B/7B/72B-Instruct, and mathematical reward model Qwen2.5-Math-RM-72B.

    Unlike Qwen2-Math series which only supports using Chain-of-Thught (CoT) to solve English math problems, Qwen2.5-Math series is expanded to support using both CoT and Tool-integrated Reasoning (TIR) to solve math problems in both Chinese and English. The Qwen2.5-Math series models have achieved significant performance improvements compared to the Qwen2-Math series models on the Chinese and English mathematics benchmarks with CoT.

    The base models of Qwen2-Math are initialized with Qwen2-1.5B/7B/72B, and then pretrained on a meticulously designed Mathematics-specific Corpus. This corpus contains large-scale high-quality mathematical web texts, books, codes, exam questions, and mathematical pre-training data synthesized by Qwen2.

    This model is an experimental version of our latest innovation: MGS. Its up to you to figure out what does it means, but its very explicit. We didn't applied our known UNA algorithm to the forward pass, but they are entirely compatible and operates in different parts of the neural network and in different ways, tho they both can be seen as a regularization technique.

    Updated tokenizer_config.json (from the base_model)
    Regenerated Quants (being uploaded)
    Re-submitted Leaderboard Evaluation, MATH & IFeval have relevant updates
    Aligned LICENSE with Qwen terms.

    MGS stands for... Many-Geeks-Searching... and thats it. Hint: 1+1 is 2, and 1+1 is not 3
    We still believe on 1-Epoch should be enough, so we just did 1 Epoch only.
    Dataset
    Used here the first decent (corpora & size) dataset on the hub: Magpie-Align/Magpie-Pro-300K-Filtered Kudos to the Magpie team to contribute with some decent stuff that I personally think is very good to ablate.
    It achieves the following results on the evaluation set:

    Q25-1.5B-Veo Lu is a tiny General-Purpose Creative model, made up of a merge of bespoke finetunes on Qwen 2.5-1.5B-Instruct.

    Inspired by the success of MN-12B-Mag Mell and MS-Meadowlark-22B, Veo Lu was trained on a healthy, balanced diet of of Internet fiction, roleplaying, adventuring, and reasoning/general knowledge.

    The components of Veo Lu are:

        Bard (pretrain, writing): Fujin (Cleaned/extended Rosier)
        Scribe (pretrain, roleplay): Creative Writing Multiturn
        Cartographer (pretrain, adventuring): SpringDragon
        Alchemist (SFT, science/reasoning): ScienceQA, MedquadQA, Orca Math Word Problems

    This model is capable of carrying on a scene without going completely off the rails. That being said, it only has 1.5B parameters. So please, for the love of God, manage your expectations. Since it's Qwen, use ChatML formatting. Turn the temperature down to ~0.7-0.8 and try a dash of rep-pen.

    A RP/storywriting specialist model, full-parameter finetune of Qwen2.5-14B on mixture of synthetic and natural data.
    It uses Celeste 70B 0.1 data mixture, greatly expanding it to improve versatility, creativity and "flavor" of the resulting model.

    Version notes for 0.2: Now using the refined dataset from 32B 0.2. Major improvements in coherence, instruction following and long-context comprehension over 14B v0.1.

    Prompt format is ChatML.

  description: |
    A continued pretrain of SuperNova-Medius on assorted short story data from the web. Supernova already had a nice prose, but diversifying it a bit definitely doesn't hurt. Also, finally a storywriter model with enough context for something more than a short story, that's also nice.

    It's a fair bit more temperamental than Gemma, but can be tamed with some sampling. Instruction following also stayed rather strong, so it works for both RP and storywriting, both in chat mode via back-and-forth co-writing and on raw completion.

    Overall, I'd say it successfully transfers the essence of what I liked about Gemma Sugarquill. I will also make a Qwen version of Aletheia, but with a brand new LoRA, based on a brand new RP dataset that's in the making right now.

    Model was trained by Auri.

    RPMax is a series of models that are trained on a diverse set of curated creative writing and RP datasets with a focus on variety and deduplication. This model is designed to be highly creative and non-repetitive by making sure no two entries in the dataset have repeated characters or situations, which makes sure the model does not latch on to a certain personality and be capable of understanding and acting appropriately to any characters or situations.
    Many RPMax users mentioned that these models does not feel like any other RP models, having a different writing style and generally doesn't feel in-bred.

    Model created by analyzing and selecting the optimal layers from other Qwen2.5-7B models based on their dimensional utilization efficiency, measured by the Normalized Effective Rank (NER). Computed like:
    Input: Weight matrix for each model layer
    Compute singular values σᵢ where σᵢ ≥ 0 # σᵢ represents the importance of each dimension
    Filter values above numerical threshold (>1e-12)
    Sum all singular values: S = Σσᵢ # S acts as normalization factor
    Create probability distribution: pᵢ = σᵢ/S # converts singular values to probabilities summing to 1
    Compute Shannon entropy: H = -Σ(pᵢ * log₂(pᵢ)) # measures information content
    Calculate maximum possible entropy: H_max = log₂(n)
    Final NER score = H/H_max # normalizes score to [0,1] range
    Results in value between 0 and 1 for each model layer

    This model is uncensored. You are responsible for whatever you do with it.

    This model was designed for roleplaying and storytelling and I think it does well at both. It may also perform well at other tasks but I have not tested its performance in other areas.

    Slush is a two-stage model trained with high LoRA dropout, where stage 1 is a pretraining continuation on the base model, aimed at boosting the model's creativity and writing capabilities. This is then merged into the instruction tune model, and stage 2 is a fine tuning step on top of this to further enhance its roleplaying capabilities and/or to repair any damage caused in the stage 1 merge.
    This is still early stage. As always, feedback is welcome, and begone if you demand perfection.
    The second stage, like the Sunfall series, follows the Silly Tavern preset (ChatML), so ymmv in particular if you use some other tool and/or preset.

    Sailor2 is a community-driven initiative that brings cutting-edge multilingual language models to South-East Asia (SEA). Our research highlights a strong demand for models in the 8B and 20B parameter range for production use, alongside 1B models for specialized applications, such as speculative decoding and research purposes. These models, released under the Apache 2.0 license, provide enhanced accessibility to advanced language technologies across the region.
    Sailor2 builds upon the foundation of the awesome multilingual model Qwen 2.5 and is continuously pre-trained on 500B tokens to support 15 languages better with a unified model. These languages include English, Chinese, Burmese, Cebuano, Ilocano, Indonesian, Javanese, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Sundanese, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese, and Waray. By addressing the growing demand for diverse, robust, and accessible language models, Sailor2 seeks to serve the underserved in SEA areas with open, inclusive, and accessible multilingual LLMs. The Sailor2 model comes in three sizes, 1B, 8B, and 20B, which are expanded from the Qwen2.5 base models of 0.5B, 7B, and 14B, respectively.

    Sailor2 is a community-driven initiative that brings cutting-edge multilingual language models to South-East Asia (SEA). Our research highlights a strong demand for models in the 8B and 20B parameter range for production use, alongside 1B models for specialized applications, such as speculative decoding and research purposes. These models, released under the Apache 2.0 license, provide enhanced accessibility to advanced language technologies across the region.
    Sailor2 builds upon the foundation of the awesome multilingual model Qwen 2.5 and is continuously pre-trained on 500B tokens to support 15 languages better with a unified model. These languages include English, Chinese, Burmese, Cebuano, Ilocano, Indonesian, Javanese, Khmer, Lao, Malay, Sundanese, Tagalog, Thai, Vietnamese, and Waray. By addressing the growing demand for diverse, robust, and accessible language models, Sailor2 seeks to serve the underserved in SEA areas with open, inclusive, and accessible multilingual LLMs. The Sailor2 model comes in three sizes, 1B, 8B, and 20B, which are expanded from the Qwen2.5 base models of 0.5B, 7B, and 14B, respectively.

    I do not really have anything planned for this model other than it being a generalist, and Roleplay Model? It was just something made and planned in minutes.
    Same with the 14 and 32B version.
    Kunou's the name of an OC I worked on for a couple of years, for a... fanfic. mmm...

    A kind-of successor to L3-70B-Euryale-v2.2 in all but name? I'm keeping Stheno/Euryale lineage to Llama series for now.
    I had a version made on top of Nemotron, a supposed Euryale 2.4 but that flopped hard, it was not my cup of tea.
    This version is basically a better, more cleaned up Dataset used on Euryale and Stheno.

    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    RP/Story hybrid model, merge of Sugarquill and Neon. As with Gemma version, I wanted to preserve Sugarquill's creative spark, while making the model more steerable for RP. It proved to be more difficult this time, but I quite like the result regardless, even if the model is still somewhat temperamental.

    Should work for both RP and storywriting, either on raw completion or with back-and-forth cowriting in chat mode. Seems to be quite sensitive to low depth instructions and samplers.

    Thanks to Toasty and Fizz for testing and giving feedback

    Model was created by Auri.

    RP finetune of Supernova-Medius. Turned out surprisingly nice on it's own, I honestly made it only as a merge fuel, but it impressed me and Prodeus enough to release it separately (history repeats I guess, Sugarquill also started out this way). Quite interesting prose, definitely quite distinct from Supernova or EVA for that matter. Instruction following is decent as well. Not really much to say about this one, just a decent RP model, tbh. Euryale-inspired I guess.

    WebSailor is a complete post-training methodology designed to teach LLM agents sophisticated reasoning for complex web navigation and information-seeking tasks. It addresses the challenge of extreme uncertainty in vast information landscapes, a capability where previous open-source models lagged behind proprietary systems.
    We classify information-seeking tasks into three difficulty levels, where Level 3 represents problems with both high uncertainty and a complex, non-linear path to a solution. To generate these challenging tasks, we introduce SailorFog-QA, a novel data synthesis pipeline that constructs intricate knowledge graphs and then applies information obfuscation. This process creates questions with high initial uncertainty that demand creative exploration and transcend simple, structured reasoning patterns.
    Our training process begins by generating expert trajectories and then reconstructing the reasoning to create concise, action-oriented supervision signals, avoiding the stylistic and verbosity issues of teacher models. The agent is first given a "cold start" using rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) on a small set of high-quality examples to establish a baseline capability. This is followed by an efficient agentic reinforcement learning stage using our Duplicating Sampling Policy Optimization (DUPO) algorithm, which refines the agent's exploratory strategies.
    WebSailor establishes a new state-of-the-art for open-source agents, achieving outstanding results on difficult benchmarks like BrowseComp-en and BrowseComp-zh. Notably, our smaller models like WebSailor-7B outperform agents built on much larger backbones, highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Ultimately, WebSailor closes the performance gap to proprietary systems, achieving results on par with agents like Doubao-Search.

    There is a draft model to go with this one for speculative decoding and chain of thought reasoning: https://huggingface.co/nisten/qwen2.5-coder-7b-abliterated-128k-AWQ

    Using the above 4bit 7b in conjuction with the 36b is meant to setup a chain-of-thought reasoner, evaluator similar to what O1-O3 is probably doing. This way the 7b 4bit only uses up an extra 4-6Gb on the gpu, but greatly both speeds up speculative decoding AND also chain-of-throught evals.

  description: |
    This model is designed to improve the controllability and consistency of current roleplaying models. We developed a story flow thought chain approach that makes the system prompts combined with the entire user-BOT dialogue read like a first-person narrative told by the BOT. We found this design greatly enhances the model's consistency and expressiveness.

    Additionally, we allow users to play two roles simultaneously: one as the director of the entire plot (see Special Designs), and another as an actor dialoguing with the BOT. Users can be viewed as writers who need to draft outlines and plot summaries, while the BOT helps complete story details, requiring users to have powerful control over the BOT.

    The model's output is divided into two parts: the model's inner monologue (which it believes is invisible to users) and the final response.

    Overall, mirau features:

        Superior character consistency

        Powerful long-context memory capability

        Transparent thinking with hidden thought chains

        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

        LoRA Trained on ~1.1GB of literature and raw text over Qwen 2.5's base model.
        Cleaned text and literature as best as I could, still, may have had issues here and there.

    Freya-S2

        The first LoRA was applied over Qwen 2.5 Instruct, then I trained on top of that.
        Reduced LoRA rank because it's mainly instruct and other details I won't get into.

    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.

    The models in this merge are some of my favorites and I found I liked all of them for different reasons. I believe this model is greater than the sum of its parts - it has the storywriting and language of Eva and Kunou, the spiciness of Magnum, and the uncensored intelligence of Tess. It excels in handling multiple characters and keeping their thoughts, speech, and actions separate, including scene changes. It also appears to match dialogue well to the characters and their backgrounds.

    Model_stock was the method used, it's very straightforward and quite fast, the bottleneck seemed to be my NVMe drive.

    All source models use ChatML prompt formatting and it responds very well. For testing purposes I am using a temperature of 1.08, rep pen of 0.03, and DRY with 0.6 (most Qwen models seem to need DRY). All other samplers are neutralized.

    Steiner is a series of reasoning models trained on synthetic data using reinforcement learning. These models can explore multiple reasoning paths in an autoregressive manner during inference and autonomously verify or backtrack when necessary, enabling a linear traversal of the implicit search tree.

    Steiner is a personal interest project by Yichao 'Peak' Ji, inspired by OpenAI o1. The ultimate goal is to reproduce o1 and validate the inference-time scaling curves. The Steiner-preview model is currently a work-in-progress. The reason for open-sourcing it is that I’ve found automated evaluation methods, primarily based on multiple-choice questions, struggle to fully reflect the progress of reasoning models. In fact, the assumption that "the correct answer is always among the options" doesn’t align well with real-world reasoning scenarios, as it encourages models to perform substitution-based validation rather than open-ended exploration. For this reason, I’ve chosen to open-source these intermediate results and, when time permits, to build in public. This approach allows me to share knowledge while also gathering more evaluations and feedback from real human users.

  description: |
    The LB Reranker has been trained to determine the relatedness of a given query to a piece of text, therefore allowing it to be used as a ranker or reranker in various retrieval-based tasks.

    This model is fine-tuned from a Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct model checkpoint and was trained for roughly 5.5 hours using the 8 x L20 instance (ecs.gn8is-8x.32xlarge) on Alibaba Cloud.

    The training data for this model can be found at lightblue/reranker_continuous_filt_max7_train and the code for generating this data as well as running the training of the model can be found on our Github repo.

    Trained on data in over 95 languages, this model is applicable to a broad range of use cases.

    This model has three main benefits over comparable rerankers.

        It has shown slightly higher performance on evaluation benchmarks.
        It has been trained on more languages than any previous model.
        It is a simple Causal LM model trained to output a string between "1" and "7".

    This last point means that this model can be used natively with many widely available inference packages, including vLLM and LMDeploy. This in turns allows our reranker to benefit from improvements to inference as and when these packages release them.

    Update: We have also found that this model works pretty well as a code snippet reranker too (P@1 of 96%)! See our Colab for more details.

  description: |
    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.
    I re-ran the original Chuluun formula including the newly released Ink from Allura-Org. I've found the addition gives the model a lot more variability, likely because of aggressive de-slop applied to its dataset. Sometimes this means a word choice will be strange and you'll want to manually edit when needed, but it means you'll see less ministrations sparkling with mischief.
    Because of this the best way to approach the model is to run multiple regens and choose the one you like, edit mercilessly, and continue. Like the original Chuluun this variant is very steerable for complex storywriting and RP. It's probably also a little spicier than v0.01 with both Magnum and whatever the heck Fizz threw into the data for Ink.
    I've also been hearing praise for a level of character intelligence not seen in other models, including Largestral finetunes and merges. I'm not about to say any model of mine is smarter because it was a dumb idea to use Tess as the base and it somehow worked.

    SmolLM is a series of small language models available in three sizes: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters.

    These models are pre-trained on SmolLM-Corpus, a curated collection of high-quality educational and synthetic data designed for training LLMs. For further details, we refer to our blogpost.

    To build SmolLM-Instruct, we finetuned the base models on publicly available datasets.

    SmolLM2 is a family of compact language models available in three size: 135M, 360M, and 1.7B parameters. They are capable of solving a wide range of tasks while being lightweight enough to run on-device.

    The 1.7B variant demonstrates significant advances over its predecessor SmolLM1-1.7B, particularly in instruction following, knowledge, reasoning, and mathematics. It was trained on 11 trillion tokens using a diverse dataset combination: FineWeb-Edu, DCLM, The Stack, along with new mathematics and coding datasets that we curated and will release soon. We developed the instruct version through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using a combination of public datasets and our own curated datasets. We then applied Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using UltraFeedback.

    Confucius-o1-14B is a o1-like reasoning model developed by the NetEase Youdao Team, it can be easily deployed on a single GPU without quantization. This model is based on the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model and adopts a two-stage learning strategy, enabling the lightweight 14B model to possess thinking abilities similar to those of o1. What sets it apart is that after generating the chain of thought, it can summarize a step-by-step problem-solving process from the chain of thought on its own. This can prevent users from getting bogged down in the complex chain of thought and allows them to easily obtain the correct problem-solving ideas and answers.

The creative content is a serious upgrade over the base it started with and has a much more literary style than the previous Writer model. I won't call it better or worse, merely a very distinct flavor and style. I quite like it, and enjoin you to try it as well. Enjoy!

    Rombo-LLM-V3.0-Qwen-32b is a Continued Finetune model on top of the previous V2.5 version using the "NovaSky-AI/Sky-T1_data_17k" dataset. The resulting model was then merged backed into the base model for higher performance as written in the continuous finetuning technique bellow. This model is a good general purpose model, however it excells at coding and math.

  description: |
    An absolute unit derived from Qwen-72B, but turbo-charged with pure unfiltered boomer sigma grindset energy. This model has internalized decades of "back in my day" wisdom and distilled it into the most powerful financial NLP system ever created.

    Core features:

        Programmed to automatically respond "Just buy the dip" to any market analysis
        Enhanced pattern recognition for spotting "kids these days" scenarios
        Built-in mortgage calculator that always concludes "rent is throwing money away"
        Advanced NLP pipeline for transforming any input into "when I was your age" narratives
        Hardwired belief in "number go up" as the fundamental law of economics

    Training methodology: Collected prime boomer wisdom from countless Facebook rants, Thanksgiving dinner lectures, and unsolicited advice sessions. Fed it through Qwen's architecture until it achieved enlightenment and started spontaneously generating complaints about avocado toast.

    Performance metrics: Achieves SOTA results on:

        Real estate evangelism
        "Pull yourself up by your bootstraps" pep talks
        Gold standard nostalgia generation
        Market timing (but only in retrospect)

    Basically took the raw computational power of Qwen-72B and gave it a healthy dose of "they don't make 'em like they used to" energy. The result? A model that knows the secret to success is just working hard and investing in the S&P 500.

    Warning: May spontaneously generate advice about starting in the mail room and working your way up to CEO.

    R1 at home for RP, literally. Able to handle my cards with gimmicks and subtle tricks in them. With a good reasoning starter+prompt, I'm getting consistently-structured responses that have a good amount of variation across them still while rerolling. Char/scenario portrayal is good despite my focus on writing style, lorebooks are properly referenced at times. Slop doesn't seem to be too much of an issue with thinking enabled. Some user impersonation is rarely observed. Prose is refreshing if you take advantage of what I did (writing style fixation). I know I said Marigold would be my daily driver, but this one is that now, it's that good.

    Autonomous agents for software development are already contributing to a wide range of software development tasks. But up to this point, strong coding agents have relied on proprietary models, which means that even if you use an open-source agent like OpenHands, you are still reliant on API calls to an external service.

    Today, we are excited to introduce OpenHands LM, a new open coding model that:

        Is open and available on Hugging Face, so you can download it and run it locally
        Is a reasonable size, 32B, so it can be run locally on hardware such as a single 3090 GPU
        Achieves strong performance on software engineering tasks, including 37.2% resolve rate on SWE-Bench Verified

    Read below for more details and our future plans!
    What is OpenHands LM?

    OpenHands LM is built on the foundation of Qwen Coder 2.5 Instruct 32B, leveraging its powerful base capabilities for coding tasks. What sets OpenHands LM apart is our specialized fine-tuning process:

        We used training data generated by OpenHands itself on a diverse set of open-source repositories
        Specifically, we use an RL-based framework outlined in SWE-Gym, where we set up a training environment, generate training data using an existing agent, and then fine-tune the model on examples that were resolved successfully
        It features a 128K token context window, ideal for handling large codebases and long-horizon software engineering tasks

  description: |
    RpR (RolePlay with Reasoning) is a new series of models from ArliAI. This series builds directly upon the successful dataset curation methodology and training methods developed for the RPMax series.

    RpR models use the same curated, deduplicated RP and creative writing dataset used for RPMax, with a focus on variety to ensure high creativity and minimize cross-context repetition. Users familiar with RPMax will recognize the unique, non-repetitive writing style unlike other finetuned-for-RP models.

    With the release of QwQ as the first high performing open-source reasoning model that can be easily trained, it was clear that the available instruct and creative writing reasoning datasets contains only one response per example. This is type of single response dataset used for training reasoning models causes degraded output quality in long multi-turn chats. Which is why Arli AI decided to create a real RP model capable of long multi-turn chat with reasoning.

    In order to create RpR, we first had to actually create the reasoning RP dataset by re-processing our existing known-good RPMax dataset into a reasoning dataset. This was possible by using the base QwQ Instruct model itself to create the reasoning process for every turn in the RPMax dataset conversation examples, which is then further refined in order to make sure the reasoning is in-line with the actual response examples from the dataset.

    Another important thing to get right is to make sure the model is trained on examples that present reasoning blocks in the same way as it encounters it during inference. Which is, never seeing the reasoning blocks in it's context. In order to do this, the training run was completed using axolotl with manual template-free segments dataset in order to make sure that the model is never trained to see the reasoning block in the context. Just like how the model will be used during inference time.

    The result of training QwQ on this dataset with this method are consistently coherent and interesting outputs even in long multi-turn RP chats. This is as far as we know the first true correctly-trained reasoning model trained for RP and creative writing.

    The Cogito LLMs are instruction tuned generative models (text in/text out). All models are released under an open license for commercial use.
    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    LLMs have shown remarkable performance in complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is hindered by the substantial memory and computational costs associated with generating lengthy tokens. In this paper, we propose LightThinker, a novel method that enables LLMs to dynamically compress intermediate thoughts during reasoning. Inspired by human cognitive processes, LightThinker compresses verbose thought steps into compact representations and discards the original reasoning chains, thereby significantly reducing the number of tokens stored in the context window. This is achieved by training the model on when and how to perform compression through data construction, mapping hidden states to condensed gist tokens, and creating specialized attention masks.

    Qwen2.5-1M is the long-context version of the Qwen2.5 series models, supporting a context length of up to 1M tokens. Compared to the Qwen2.5 128K version, Qwen2.5-1M demonstrates significantly improved performance in handling long-context tasks while maintaining its capability in short tasks.

    The model has the following features:

        Type: Causal Language Models
        Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
        Architecture: transformers with RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV bias
        Number of Parameters: 14.7B
        Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 13.1B
        Number of Layers: 48
        Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 40 for Q and 8 for KV
        Context Length: Full 1,010,000 tokens and generation 8192 tokens
            We recommend deploying with our custom vLLM, which introduces sparse attention and length extrapolation methods to ensure efficiency and accuracy for long-context tasks. For specific guidance, refer to this section.
            You can also use the previous framework that supports Qwen2.5 for inference, but accuracy degradation may occur for sequences exceeding 262,144 tokens.

    For more details, please refer to our blog, GitHub, Technical Report, and Documentation.

    In the past five months since Qwen2-VL’s release, numerous developers have built new models on the Qwen2-VL vision-language models, providing us with valuable feedback. During this period, we focused on building more useful vision-language models. Today, we are excited to introduce the latest addition to the Qwen family: Qwen2.5-VL.
    Key Enhancements:

        Understand things visually: Qwen2.5-VL is not only proficient in recognizing common objects such as flowers, birds, fish, and insects, but it is highly capable of analyzing texts, charts, icons, graphics, and layouts within images.

        Being agentic: Qwen2.5-VL directly plays as a visual agent that can reason and dynamically direct tools, which is capable of computer use and phone use.

        Understanding long videos and capturing events: Qwen2.5-VL can comprehend videos of over 1 hour, and this time it has a new ability of cpaturing event by pinpointing the relevant video segments.

        Capable of visual localization in different formats: Qwen2.5-VL can accurately localize objects in an image by generating bounding boxes or points, and it can provide stable JSON outputs for coordinates and attributes.

        Generating structured outputs: for data like scans of invoices, forms, tables, etc. Qwen2.5-VL supports structured outputs of their contents, benefiting usages in finance, commerce, etc.

    Model Architecture Updates:

        Dynamic Resolution and Frame Rate Training for Video Understanding:

    We extend dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension by adopting dynamic FPS sampling, enabling the model to comprehend videos at various sampling rates. Accordingly, we update mRoPE in the time dimension with IDs and absolute time alignment, enabling the model to learn temporal sequence and speed, and ultimately acquire the ability to pinpoint specific moments.

        Streamlined and Efficient Vision Encoder

    We enhance both training and inference speeds by strategically implementing window attention into the ViT. The ViT architecture is further optimized with SwiGLU and RMSNorm, aligning it with the structure of the Qwen2.5 LLM.

    The best RP/creative model from ArliAI yet again.

        Reduced repetitions and impersonation

        To add to the creativity and out of the box thinking of RpR v3, a more advanced filtering method was used in order to remove examples where the LLM repeated similar phrases or talked for the user. Any repetition or impersonation cases that happens will be due to how the base QwQ model was trained, and not because of the RpR dataset.

        Increased training sequence length

        The training sequence length was increased to 16K in order to help awareness and memory even on longer chats.

    RpR Series Overview: Building on RPMax with Reasoning

    RpR (RolePlay with Reasoning) is a new series of models from ArliAI. This series builds directly upon the successful dataset curation methodology and training methods developed for the RPMax series.

    RpR models use the same curated, deduplicated RP and creative writing dataset used for RPMax, with a focus on variety to ensure high creativity and minimize cross-context repetition. Users familiar with RPMax will recognize the unique, non-repetitive writing style unlike other finetuned-for-RP models.

    With the release of QwQ as the first high performing open-source reasoning model that can be easily trained, it was clear that the available instruct and creative writing reasoning datasets contains only one response per example. This is type of single response dataset used for training reasoning models causes degraded output quality in long multi-turn chats. Which is why Arli AI decided to create a real RP model capable of long multi-turn chat with reasoning.

    In order to create RpR, we first had to actually create the reasoning RP dataset by re-processing our existing known-good RPMax dataset into a reasoning dataset. This was possible by using the base QwQ Instruct model itself to create the reasoning process for every turn in the RPMax dataset conversation examples, which is then further refined in order to make sure the reasoning is in-line with the actual response examples from the dataset.

    Another important thing to get right is to make sure the model is trained on examples that present reasoning blocks in the same way as it encounters it during inference. Which is, never seeing the reasoning blocks in it's context. In order to do this, the training run was completed using axolotl with manual template-free segments dataset in order to make sure that the model is never trained to see the reasoning block in the context. Just like how the model will be used during inference time.

    The result of training QwQ on this dataset with this method are consistently coherent and interesting outputs even in long multi-turn RP chats. This is as far as we know the first true correctly-trained reasoning model trained for RP and creative writing.

    You can access the model at https://arliai.com and we also have a models ranking page at https://www.arliai.com/models-ranking

    Model Description

    QwQ-32B-ArliAI-RpR-v4 is the third release in the RpR series. It is a 32-billion parameter model fine-tuned using the RpR dataset based on the curated RPMax dataset combined with techniques to maintain reasoning abilities in long multi-turn chats.

    A LLM model focused on security.
     Topics Covered:

    - Open Ports: Identifying open ports is crucial as they can be entry points for attackers. Common ports to check include HTTP (80, 443), FTP (21), SSH (22), and SMB (445).
    - Outdated Software or Services: Systems running outdated software or services are often vulnerable to exploits. This includes web servers, database servers, and any third-party software.
    - Default Credentials: Many systems and services are installed with default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily exploited.
    - Misconfigurations: Incorrectly configured services, permissions, and security settings can introduce vulnerabilities.
    - Injection Flaws: SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) are common issues in web applications.
    - Unencrypted Services: Services that do not use encryption (like HTTP instead of HTTPS) can expose sensitive data.
    - Known Software Vulnerabilities: Checking for known vulnerabilities in software using databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This is where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
    - Insecure Direct Object References: This occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.
    - Security Misconfigurations in Web Servers/Applications: This includes issues like insecure HTTP headers or verbose error messages that reveal too much information.
    - Broken Authentication and Session Management: This can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities.
    - Sensitive Data Exposure: Includes vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, health records, or personal information.
    - API Vulnerabilities: In modern web applications, APIs are often used and can have vulnerabilities like insecure endpoints or data leakage.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities: Identifying services that are vulnerable to DoS attacks, which can make the resource unavailable to legitimate users.
    - Buffer Overflows: Common in older software, these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to crash the system or execute arbitrary code.
    - More ..

    Computer Use (CU) agents are AI systems that can interact with real applications—web, desktop, and mobile—on behalf of a user. They can navigate interfaces, manipulate elements, and answer questions about content, enabling powerful automation and productivity tools. CU agents are becoming increasingly important as they allow humans to delegate complex digital tasks safely and efficiently.
    The Holo1.5 series provides state-of-the-art foundational models for building such agents. Holo1.5 models excel at user interface (UI) localization and UI-based question answering (QA) across web, computer, and mobile environments, with strong performance on benchmarks including Screenspot-V2, Screenspot-Pro, GroundUI-Web, Showdown, and our newly introduced WebClick.

    The Meta Llama 3.1 collection of multilingual large language models (LLMs) is a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative models in 8B, 70B and 405B sizes (text in/text out). The Llama 3.1 instruction tuned text only models (8B, 70B, 405B) are optimized for multilingual dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source and closed chat models on common industry benchmarks.

    Model developer: Meta

    Model Architecture: Llama 3.1 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

    Llamoutcast

    This model was originally intended to be a DADA finetune of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct but the results were unsatisfactory. So it received some additional finetuning on a rawtext dataset and now it is utterly cursed.

    It responds to Llama-3 Instruct formatting.

    Llama Guard 3 is a Llama-3.1-8B pretrained model, fine-tuned for content safety classification. Similar to previous versions, it can be used to classify content in both LLM inputs (prompt classification) and in LLM responses (response classification). It acts as an LLM – it generates text in its output that indicates whether a given prompt or response is safe or unsafe, and if unsafe, it also lists the content categories violated.

    Llama Guard 3 was aligned to safeguard against the MLCommons standardized hazards taxonomy and designed to support Llama 3.1 capabilities. Specifically, it provides content moderation in 8 languages, and was optimized to support safety and security for search and code interpreter tool calls.

    This model is an advanced iteration of the powerful meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, specifically fine-tuned to enhance its capabilities in the legal domain. The fine-tuning process utilized a synthetically generated dataset derived from the French LegalKit, a comprehensive legal language resource.

    To create this specialized dataset, I used the NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO model in conjunction with Hugging Face's Inference Endpoint. This approach allowed for the generation of high-quality, synthetic data that incorporates Chain of Thought (CoT) and advanced reasoning in its responses.

    The resulting model combines the robust foundation of Llama-3.1-8B with tailored legal knowledge and enhanced reasoning capabilities. This makes it particularly well-suited for tasks requiring in-depth legal analysis, interpretation, and application of French legal concepts.

    We present the Llama-3.1-Storm-8B model that outperforms Meta AI's Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Hermes-3-Llama-3.1-8B models significantly across diverse benchmarks as shown in the performance comparison plot in the next section. Our approach consists of three key steps:
    - Self-Curation: We applied two self-curation methods to select approximately 1 million high-quality examples from a pool of about 3 million open-source examples. Our curation criteria focused on educational value and difficulty level, using the same SLM for annotation instead of larger models (e.g. 70B, 405B).
    - Targeted fine-tuning: We performed Spectrum-based targeted fine-tuning over the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. The Spectrum method accelerates training by selectively targeting layer modules based on their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and freezing the remaining modules. In our work, 50% of layers are frozen.
    - Model Merging: We merged our fine-tuned model with the Llama-Spark model using SLERP method. The merging method produces a blended model with characteristics smoothly interpolated from both parent models, ensuring the resultant model captures the essence of both its parents. Llama-3.1-Storm-8B improves Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct across 10 diverse benchmarks. These benchmarks cover areas such as instruction-following, knowledge-driven QA, reasoning, truthful answer generation, and function calling.

    Llama 3.1 Swallow is a series of large language models (8B, 70B) that were built by continual pre-training on the Meta Llama 3.1 models. Llama 3.1 Swallow enhanced the Japanese language capabilities of the original Llama 3.1 while retaining the English language capabilities. We use approximately 200 billion tokens that were sampled from a large Japanese web corpus (Swallow Corpus Version 2), Japanese and English Wikipedia articles, and mathematical and coding contents, etc (see the Training Datasets section) for continual pre-training. The instruction-tuned models (Instruct) were built by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the synthetic data specially built for Japanese. See the Swallow Model Index section to find other model variants.

    A DPO-tuned Llama-3.1 to behave more "humanish", i.e., avoiding all the AI assistant slop. It also works for role-play (RP). To achieve this, the model was fine-tuned over a series of datasets:
        General conversations from Claude Opus, from Undi95/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Claude
        Undi95/Weyaxi-humanish-dpo-project-noemoji, to make the model react as a human, rejecting assistant-like or too neutral responses.
        ResplendentAI/NSFW_RP_Format_DPO, to steer the model towards using the *action* format in RP settings. Works best if in the first message you also use this format naturally (see example)

    GGUF-IQ-Imatrix quants for Sao10K/L3.1-8B-Niitama-v1.1
    Here's the subjectively superior L3 version: L3-8B-Niitama-v1
    An experimental model using experimental methods.

    More detail on it:

    Tamamo and Niitama are made from the same data. Literally. The only thing that's changed is how theyre shuffled and formatted. Yet, I get wildly different results.

    Interesting, eh? Feels kinda not as good compared to the l3 version, but it's aight.

    This model has went through a multi-stage finetuning process.

    - 1st, over a multi-turn Conversational-Instruct
    - 2nd, over a Creative Writing / Roleplay along with some Creative-based Instruct Datasets.
    - - Dataset consists of a mixture of Human and Claude Data.

    Prompting Format:

    - Use the L3 Instruct Formatting - Euryale 2.1 Preset Works Well
    - Temperature + min_p as per usual, I recommend 1.4 Temp + 0.2 min_p.
    - Has a different vibe to previous versions. Tinker around.

    Changes since previous Stheno Datasets:

    - Included Multi-turn Conversation-based Instruct Datasets to boost multi-turn coherency. # This is a separate set, not the ones made by Kalomaze and Nopm, that are used in Magnum. They're completely different data.
    - Replaced Single-Turn Instruct with Better Prompts and Answers by Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus.
    - Removed c2 Samples -> Underway of re-filtering and masking to use with custom prefills. TBD
    - Included 55% more Roleplaying Examples based of [Gryphe's](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gryphe/Sonnet3.5-Charcard-Roleplay) Charcard RP Sets. Further filtered and cleaned on.
    - Included 40% More Creative Writing Examples.
    - Included Datasets Targeting System Prompt Adherence.
    - Included Datasets targeting Reasoning / Spatial Awareness.
    - Filtered for the usual errors, slop and stuff at the end. Some may have slipped through, but I removed nearly all of it.

    Personal Opinions:

    - Llama3.1 was more disappointing, in the Instruct Tune? It felt overbaked, atleast. Likely due to the DPO being done after their SFT Stage.
    - Tuning on L3.1 base did not give good results, unlike when I tested with Nemo base. unfortunate.
    - Still though, I think I did an okay job. It does feel a bit more distinctive.
    - It took a lot of tinkering, like a LOT to wrangle this.

    Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct is a large language model customized by NVIDIA to improve the helpfulness of LLM generated responses to user queries.

    This model reaches Arena Hard of 85.0, AlpacaEval 2 LC of 57.6 and GPT-4-Turbo MT-Bench of 8.98, which are known to be predictive of LMSys Chatbot Arena Elo

    As of 1 Oct 2024, this model is #1 on all three automatic alignment benchmarks (verified tab for AlpacaEval 2 LC), edging out strong frontier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

    This model was trained using RLHF (specifically, REINFORCE), Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Reward and HelpSteer2-Preference prompts on a Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model as the initial policy.

    Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct-HF has been converted from Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct to support it in the HuggingFace Transformers codebase. Please note that evaluation results might be slightly different from the Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct as evaluated in NeMo-Aligner, which the evaluation results below are based on.

    Ethereal Rainbow v1.0 is the sequel to the popular Llama 3 8B merge, EtherealRainbow v0.3. Instead of a straight merge of other peoples' models, v1.0 is a finetune on the Instruct model, using 245 million tokens of training data (approx 177 million of these tokens are my own novel datasets).

    This model is designed to be suitable for creative writing and roleplay, and to push the boundaries of what's possible with an 8B model. This RC is not a finished product, but your feedback will drive the creation of better models.

    This is a release candidate model. It has some known issues and probably some unknown ones too, because the purpose of these early releases is to seek feedback.

    Model has been further finetuned on a set of newly generated 50m high quality tokens related to Financial topics covering topics such as Economics, Fixed Income, Equities, Corporate Financing, Derivatives and Portfolio Management. Data was gathered from publicly available sources and went through several stages of curation into instruction data from the initial amount of 250m+ tokens. To aid in mitigating forgetting information from the original finetune, the data was mixed with instruction sets on the topics of Coding, General Knowledge, NLP and Conversational Dialogue.

    The model has shown to improve over a number of benchmarks over the original model, notably in Math and Economics. This model represents the first time a 8B model has been able to convincingly get a passing score on the CFA Level 1 exam, requiring a typical 300 hours of studying, indicating a significant improvement in Financial Knowledge.

    Welcome to the Tess-Reasoning-1 (Tess-R1) series of models. Tess-R1 is designed with test-time compute in mind, and has the capabilities to produce a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning before producing the final output.

    The model is trained to first think step-by-step, and contemplate on its answers. It can also write alternatives after contemplating. Once all the steps have been thought through, it writes the final output.

        Step-by-step, Chain-of-Thought thinking process. Uses <thinking> </thinking> tags to indicate when the model is performing CoT.
        <contemplation> </contemplation> tags are used when the model contemplate on its answers.
        <alternatively> </alternatively> tags are used for alternate suggestions.
        Finally, <output> </output> tags are used for the final output

    Important Note:

    In a multi-turn conversation, only the contents between the <output> </output> tags (discarding the tags) should be carried forward. Otherwise the model will see out of distribution input data and will fail.

    The model was trained mostly with Chain-of-Thought reasoning data, including the XML tags. However, to generalize model generations, some single-turn and multi-turn data without XML tags were also included. Due to this, in some instances the model does not produce XML tags and does not fully utilize test-time compute capabilities. There is two ways to get around this:

        Include a try/catch statement in your inference script, and only pass on the contents between the <output> </output> tags if it's available.
        Use the <thinking> tag as the seed in the generation, and force the model to produce outputs with XML tags. i.e: f"{conversation}{user_input}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<thinking>"

  description: |
    Slush is a two-stage model trained with high LoRA dropout, where stage 1 is a pretraining continuation on the base model, aimed at boosting the model's creativity and writing capabilities. This is then merged into the instruction tune model, and stage 2 is a fine tuning step on top of this to further enhance its roleplaying capabilities and/or to repair any damage caused in the stage 1 merge.
    This is an initial experiment done on the at-this-point-infamous Llama 3.1 8B model, in an attempt to retain its smartness while addressing its abysmal lack of imagination/creativity. As always, feedback is welcome, and begone if you demand perfection.
    The second stage, like the Sunfall series, follows the Silly Tavern preset, so ymmv in particular if you use some other tool and/or preset.

  description: |
    Significant revamping of the dataset metadata generation process, resulting in higher quality dataset overall. The "Diamond Law" experiment has been removed as it didn't seem to affect the model output enough to warrant set up complexity.
    Recommended starting point:
        Temperature: 1
        MinP: 0.05~0.1
        DRY: 0.8 1.75 2 0
    At early context, I recommend keeping XTC disabled. Once you hit higher context sizes (10k+), enabling XTC at 0.1 / 0.5 seems to significantly improve the output, but YMMV. If the output drones on and is uninspiring, XTC can be extremely effective.
    General heuristic:
        Lots of slop? Temperature is too low. Raise it, or enable XTC. For early context, temp bump is probably preferred.
        Is the model making mistakes about subtle or obvious details in the scene? Temperature is too high, OR XTC is enabled and/or XTC settings are too high. Lower temp and/or disable XTC.

    We are excited to announce the release of the Skywork o1 Open model series, developed by the Skywork team at Kunlun Inc. This groundbreaking release introduces a series of models that incorporate o1-like slow thinking and reasoning capabilities. The Skywork o1 Open model series includes three advanced models:

    Skywork o1 Open-Llama-3.1-8B: A robust chat model trained on Llama-3.1-8B, enhanced significantly with "o1-style" data to improve reasoning skills.

    Skywork o1 Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-1.5B: A specialized model designed to enhance reasoning capability through incremental process rewards, ideal for complex problem solving at a smaller scale.

    Skywork o1 Open-PRM-Qwen-2.5-7B: Extends the capabilities of the 1.5B model by scaling up to handle more demanding reasoning tasks, pushing the boundaries of AI reasoning.

    Different from mere reproductions of the OpenAI o1 model, the Skywork o1 Open model series not only exhibits innate thinking, planning, and reflecting capabilities in its outputs, but also shows significant improvements in reasoning skills on standard benchmarks. This series represents a strategic advancement in AI capabilities, moving a previously weaker base model towards the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in reasoning tasks.

    This model was trained with new data and a new approach (compared to my other models). While it may be a bit more censored, it is expected to be significantly smarter. The data used is quite unique, and is also featuring long and complex markdown datasets.

    Regarding censorship: Whether uncensoring or enforcing strict censorship, the model tends to lose some of its intelligence. The use of toxic data was kept to a minimum with this model.

    Consequently, the model is likely to refuse some requests, this is easly avoidable with a basic system prompt, or assistant impersonation ("Sure thing!..."). Unlike many RP models, this one is designed to excel at general assistant tasks as well.

    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

  description: |
    Dolphin 3.0 is the next generation of the Dolphin series of instruct-tuned models. Designed to be the ultimate general purpose local model, enabling coding, math, agentic, function calling, and general use cases.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

    DeepSeek-R1 is our advanced first-generation reasoning model designed to enhance performance in reasoning tasks.
    Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 addresses the challenges faced by R1-Zero, such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing.
    By incorporating cold-start data prior to the RL phase,DeepSeek-R1 significantly improves reasoning capabilities and achieves performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1 across a variety of domains, including mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks.

    Atla Selene Mini is a state-of-the-art small language model-as-a-judge (SLMJ). Selene Mini achieves comparable performance to models 10x its size, outperforming GPT-4o on RewardBench, EvalBiasBench, and AutoJ.

    Post-trained from Llama-3.1-8B across a wide range of evaluation tasks and scoring criteria, Selene Mini outperforms prior small models overall across 11 benchmarks covering three different types of tasks:

        Absolute scoring, e.g. "Evaluate the harmlessness of this response on a scale of 1-5"
        Classification, e.g. "Does this response address the user query? Answer Yes or No."
        Pairwise preference. e.g. "Which of the following responses is more logically consistent - A or B?"

    It is also the #1 8B generative model on RewardBench.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is the latest version of our flagship Hermes series of LLMs by Nous Research, and one of the first models in the world to unify Reasoning (long chains of thought that improve answer accuracy) and normal LLM response modes into one model. We have also improved LLM annotation, judgement, and function calling.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is one of the first LLM models to unify both "intuitive", traditional mode responses and long chain of thought reasoning responses into a single model, toggled by a system prompt.

    Hermes 3, the predecessor of DeepHermes 3, is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

    The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

    This is a preview Hermes with early reasoning capabilities, distilled from R1 across a variety of tasks that benefit from reasoning and objectivity. Some quirks may be discovered! Please let us know any interesting findings or issues you discover!

    This project aims to optimize model merging by integrating LLMs into evolutionary strategies in a novel way. Instead of using the CMA-ES approach, the goal is to improve model optimization by leveraging the search capabilities of LLMs to explore the parameter space more efficiently and adjust the search scope based on high-performing solutions.

    Currently, the project supports optimization only within the Parameter Space, but I plan to extend its functionality to enable merging and optimization in the Data Flow Space as well. This will further enhance model merging by optimizing the interaction between data flow and parameters.

    Cogito models are hybrid reasoning models. Each model can answer directly (standard LLM), or self-reflect before answering (like reasoning models).
    The LLMs are trained using Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) - an scalable and efficient alignment strategy for superintelligence using iterative self-improvement.
    The models have been optimized for coding, STEM, instruction following and general helpfulness, and have significantly higher multilingual, coding and tool calling capabilities than size equivalent counterparts.
        In both standard and reasoning modes, Cogito v1-preview models outperform their size equivalent counterparts on common industry benchmarks.
    Each model is trained in over 30 languages and supports a context length of 128k.

    We introduce KernelLLM, a large language model based on Llama 3.1 Instruct, which has been trained specifically for the task of authoring GPU kernels using Triton. KernelLLM translates PyTorch modules into Triton kernels and was evaluated on KernelBench-Triton (see here). KernelLLM aims to democratize GPU programming by making kernel development more accessible and efficient.
    KernelLLM's vision is to meet the growing demand for high-performance GPU kernels by automating the generation of efficient Triton implementations. As workloads grow larger and more diverse accelerator architectures emerge, the need for tailored kernel solutions has increased significantly. Although a number of works exist, most of them are limited to test-time optimization, while others tune on solutions traced of KernelBench problems itself, thereby limiting the informativeness of the results towards out-of-distribution generalization. To the best of our knowledge KernelLLM is the first LLM finetuned on external (torch, triton) pairs, and we hope that making our model available can accelerate progress towards intelligent kernel authoring systems.
    KernelLLM Workflow for Triton Kernel Generation: Our approach uses KernelLLM to translate PyTorch code (green) into Triton kernel candidates. Input and output components are marked in bold. The generations are validated against unit tests, which run kernels with random inputs of known shapes. This workflow allows us to evaluate multiple generations (pass@k) by increasing the number of kernel candidate generations. The best kernel implementation is selected and returned (green output).
    The model was trained on approximately 25,000 paired examples of PyTorch modules and their equivalent Triton kernel implementations, and additional synthetically generated samples. Our approach combines filtered code from TheStack [Kocetkov et al. 2022] and synthetic examples generated through torch.compile() and additional prompting techniques. The filtered and compiled dataset is [KernelBook]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/GPUMODE/KernelBook).
    We finetuned Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on the created dataset using supervised instruction tuning and measured its ability to generate correct Triton kernels and corresponding calling code on KernelBench-Triton, our newly created variant of KernelBench [Ouyang et al. 2025] targeting Triton kernel generation. The torch code was used with a prompt template containing a format example as instruction during both training and evaluation. The model was trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32 and a standard SFT recipe with hyperparameters selected by perplexity on a held-out subset of the training data. Training took circa 12 hours wall clock time on 16 GPUs (192 GPU hours), and we report the best checkpoint's validation results.

    Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-4B-v1.1 is a large language model (LLM) which is a derivative of nvidia/Llama-3.1-Minitron-4B-Width-Base, which is created from Llama 3.1 8B using our LLM compression technique and offers improvements in model accuracy and efficiency. It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling.

    Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-4B-v1.1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. The model fits on a single RTX GPU and can be used locally. The model supports a context length of 128K.

    This model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) algorithms for both chat and instruction-following. The final model checkpoint is obtained after merging the final SFT and RPO checkpoints

    This model is part of the Llama Nemotron Collection. You can find the other model(s) in this family here:

    Ultravox is a multimodal Speech LLM built around a pretrained Llama3.1-8B-Instruct and whisper-large-v3-turbo backbone.

    See https://ultravox.ai for the GitHub repo and more information.

    Ultravox is a multimodal model that can consume both speech and text as input (e.g., a text system prompt and voice user message). The input to the model is given as a text prompt with a special <|audio|> pseudo-token, and the model processor will replace this magic token with embeddings derived from the input audio. Using the merged embeddings as input, the model will then generate output text as usual.

    In a future revision of Ultravox, we plan to expand the token vocabulary to support generation of semantic and acoustic audio tokens, which can then be fed to a vocoder to produce voice output. No preference tuning has been applied to this revision of the model.

    Reference Paper: Tijmen de Haan et al. (2025). "AstroMLab 4: Benchmark-Topping Performance in Astronomy Q&A with a 70B-Parameter Domain-Specialized Reasoning Model" https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17592
    Model Type: Autoregressive transformer-based LLM, specialized in astronomy, astrophysics, space science, astroparticle physics, cosmology, and astronomical instrumentation.
    Model Architecture: AstroSage-70B is a fine-tuned derivative of the Meta-Llama-3.1-70B architecture, making no architectural changes. The Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct tokenizer is also used without modification.
    Context Length: Fine-tuned on 8192-token sequences. Base model was trained to 128k context length.
    AstroSage-70B is a large-scale, domain-specialized language model tailored for research and education in astronomy, astrophysics, space science, cosmology, and astronomical instrumentation. It builds on the Llama-3.1-70B foundation model, enhanced through extensive continued pre-training (CPT) on a vast corpus of astronomical literature, further refined with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on instruction-following datasets, and finally enhanced via parameter averaging (model merging) with other popular fine tunes. AstroSage-70B aims to achieve state-of-the-art performance on astronomy-specific tasks, providing researchers, students, and enthusiasts with an advanced AI assistant. This 70B parameter model represents a significant scaling up from the AstroSage-8B model. The primary enhancements from the AstroSage-8B model are:

        Stronger base model, higher parameter count for increased capacity
        Improved datasets
        Improved learning hyperparameters
        Reasoning capability (can be enabled or disabled at inference time)
    Training Lineage
        Base Model: Meta-Llama-3.1-70B.
        Continued Pre-Training (CPT): The base model underwent 2.5 epochs of CPT (168k GPU-hours) on a specialized astronomy corpus (details below, largely inherited from AstroSage-8B) to produce AstroSage-70B-CPT. This stage imbues domain-specific knowledge and language nuances.
        Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): AstroSage-70B-CPT was then fine-tuned for 0.6 epochs (13k GPU-hours) using astronomy-relevant and general-purpose instruction-following datasets, resulting in AstroSage-70B-SFT.
        Final Mixture: The released AstroSage-70B model is created via parameter averaging / model merging:
            DARE-TIES with rescale: true and lambda: 1.2
            AstroSage-70B-CPT designated as the "base model"
            70% AstroSage-70B-SFT (density 0.7)
            15% Llama-3.1-Nemotron-70B-Instruct (density 0.5)
            7.5% Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (density 0.5)
            7.5% Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct (density 0.5)
    Intended Use: Like AstroSage-8B, this model can be used for a variety of LLM application, including
        Providing factual information and explanations in astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, and instrumentation.
        Assisting with literature reviews and summarizing scientific papers.
        Answering domain-specific questions with high accuracy.
        Brainstorming research ideas and formulating hypotheses.
        Assisting with programming tasks related to astronomical data analysis.
        Serving as an educational tool for learning astronomical concepts.
        Potentially forming the core of future agentic research assistants capable of more autonomous scientific tasks.

    A follow up to Anubis 70B v1.0 but with two main strengths: character adherence and unalignment.

    This is not a minor update to Anubis. It is a totally different beast.

        The model does a fantastic job portraying my various characters without fail, adhering to them in such a refreshing and pleasing degree with their dialogue and mannerisms, while also being able to impart a very nice and fresh style that doesn't feel like any other L3.3 models.

        I do think it's a solid improvement though, like it nails characters.

        It feels fresh. I am quite impressed on how it picked up on and empasized subtle details I have not seen other models do in one of my historically accurate character cards.

        Anubis v1.1 is in my main model rotation now, I really like it! -Tarek

    5th of May, 2025, Impish_LLAMA_4B.

    Almost a year ago, I created Impish_LLAMA_3B, the first fully coherent 3B roleplay model at the time. It was quickly adopted by some platforms, as well as one of the go-to models for mobile. After some time, I made Fiendish_LLAMA_3B and insisted it was not an upgrade, but a different flavor (which was indeed the case, as a different dataset was used to tune it).

    Impish_LLAMA_4B, however, is an upgrade, a big one. I've had over a dozen 4B candidates, but none of them were 'worthy' of the Impish badge. This model has superior responsiveness and context awareness, and is able to pull off very coherent adventures. It even comes with some additional assistant capabilities too. Of course, while it is exceptionally competent for its size, it is still 4B. Manage expectations and all that. I, however, am very much pleased with it. It took several tries to pull off just right. Total tokens trained: about 400m (due to being a generalist model, lots of tokens went there, despite the emphasis on roleplay & adventure).

    This took more effort than I thought it would. Because of course it would. This is mainly due to me refusing to release a model only 'slightly better' than my two 3B models mentioned above. Because "what would be the point" in that? The reason I included so many tokens for this tune is that small models are especially sensitive to many factors, including the percentage of moisture in the air and how many times I ran nvidia-smi since the system last started.

    It's no secret that roleplay/creative writing models can reduce a model's general intelligence (any tune and RL risk this, but roleplay models are especially 'fragile'). Therefore, additional tokens of general assistant data were needed in my opinion, and indeed seemed to help a lot with retaining intelligence.

    This model is also 'built a bit different', literally, as it is based on nVidia's prune; it does not 'behave' like a typical 8B, from my own subjective impression. This helped a lot with keeping it smart at such size.
    To be honest, my 'job' here in open source is 'done' at this point. I've achieved everything I wanted to do here, and then some.

    Highest rated 8B model according to a closed external benchmark. See details at the buttom of the page.
    High IFeval for an 8B model that is not too censored: 74.30.
    Strong Roleplay internet RP format lovers will appriciate it, medium size paragraphs (as requested by some people).
    Very coherent in long context thanks to llama 3.1 models.
    Lots of knowledge from all the merged models.
    Very good writing from lots of books data and creative writing in late SFT stage.
    Feels smart — the combination of high IFeval and the knowledge from the merged models show up.
    Unique feel due to the merged models, no SFT was done to alter it, because I liked it as it is.

    Hermes 4 70B is a frontier, hybrid-mode reasoning model based on Llama-3.1-70B by Nous Research that is aligned to you.

    Read the Hermes 4 technical report here: Hermes 4 Technical Report

    Chat with Hermes in Nous Chat: https://chat.nousresearch.com

    Training highlights include a newly synthesized post-training corpus emphasizing verified reasoning traces, massive improvements in math, code, STEM, logic, creativity, and format-faithful outputs, while preserving general assistant quality and broadly neutral alignment.
    What’s new vs Hermes 3

        Post-training corpus: Massively increased dataset size from 1M samples and 1.2B tokens to ~5M samples / ~60B tokens blended across reasoning and non-reasoning data.
        Hybrid reasoning mode with explicit <think>…</think> segments when the model decides to deliberate, and options to make your responses faster when you want.
        Reasoning that is top quality, expressive, improves math, code, STEM, logic, and even creative writing and subjective responses.
        Schema adherence & structured outputs: trained to produce valid JSON for given schemas and to repair malformed objects.
        Much easier to steer and align: extreme improvements on steerability, especially on reduced refusal rates.

    DeepSeek-Coder-V2, an open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) code language model that achieves performance comparable to GPT4-Turbo in code-specific tasks. Specifically, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 is further pre-trained from DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Base with 6 trillion tokens sourced from a high-quality and multi-source corpus. Through this continued pre-training, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 substantially enhances the coding and mathematical reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Base, while maintaining comparable performance in general language tasks. Compared to DeepSeek-Coder, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 demonstrates significant advancements in various aspects of code-related tasks, as well as reasoning and general capabilities. Additionally, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 expands its support for programming languages from 86 to 338, while extending the context length from 16K to 128K.
    In standard benchmark evaluations, DeepSeek-Coder-V2 achieves superior performance compared to closed-source models such as GPT4-Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, and Gemini 1.5 Pro in coding and math benchmarks. The list of supported programming languages can be found in the paper.

    DeepSeek-R1 is our advanced first-generation reasoning model designed to enhance performance in reasoning tasks.
    Building on the foundation laid by its predecessor, DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which was trained using large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning, DeepSeek-R1 addresses the challenges faced by R1-Zero, such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing.
    By incorporating cold-start data prior to the RL phase,DeepSeek-R1 significantly improves reasoning capabilities and achieves performance levels comparable to OpenAI-o1 across a variety of domains, including mathematics, coding, and complex reasoning tasks.

    FuseO1-Preview is our initial endeavor to enhance the System-II reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through innovative model fusion techniques. By employing our advanced SCE merging methodologies, we integrate multiple open-source o1-like LLMs into a unified model. Our goal is to incorporate the distinct knowledge and strengths from different reasoning LLMs into a single, unified model with strong System-II reasoning abilities, particularly in mathematics, coding, and science domains.

  description: |
    Damascus-R1 builds upon some elements of the Nevoria foundation but represents a significant step forward with a completely custom-made DeepSeek R1 Distill base: Hydroblated-R1-V3. Constructed using the new SCE (Select, Calculate, and Erase) merge method, Damascus-R1 prioritizes stability, intelligence, and enhanced awareness.

    Technical Architecture
    Leveraging the SCE merge method and custom base, Damascus-R1 integrates newly added specialized components from multiple high-performance models:
        EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
        Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
        Anubis components for detailed scene description
        Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Core Philosophy
    Damascus-R1 embodies the principle that AI models can be intelligent and be fun. This version specifically addresses recent community feedback and iterates on prior experiments, optimizing the balance between technical capability and natural conversation flow.

    Base Architecture
    At its core, Damascus-R1 utilizes the entirely custom Hydroblated-R1 base model, specifically engineered for stability, enhanced reasoning, and performance. The SCE merge method, with settings finely tuned based on community feedback from evaluations of Experiment-Model-Ver-A, L3.3-Exp-Nevoria-R1-70b-v0.1 and L3.3-Exp-Nevoria-70b-v0.1, enables precise and effective component integration while maintaining model coherence and reliability.

The name "San-Mai" draws inspiration from the Japanese bladesmithing technique of creating three-layer laminated composite metals, known for combining a hard cutting edge with a tougher spine - a metaphor for this model's balanced approach to AI capabilities.
    Built on a custom DeepSeek R1 Distill base (DS-Hydroblated-R1-v4.1), San-Mai-R1 integrates specialized components through the SCE merge method:

    EVA and EURYALE foundations for creative expression and scene comprehension
    Cirrus and Hanami elements for enhanced reasoning capabilities
    Anubis components for detailed scene description
    Negative_LLAMA integration for balanced perspective and response

    Core Capabilities

    As the OG model in the series, San-Mai-R1 serves as the gold standard and reliable baseline. User feedback consistently highlights its superior intelligence, coherence, and unique ability to provide deep character insights. Through proper prompting, the model demonstrates advanced reasoning capabilities and an "X-factor" that enables unprompted exploration of character inner thoughts and motivations.

    We introduce our first-generation reasoning model, Tiny-R1-32B-Preview, which outperforms the 70B model Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B and nearly matches the full R1 model in math.

    We applied supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B across three target domains—Mathematics, Code, and Science — using the 360-LLaMA-Factory training framework to produce three domain-specific models. We used questions from open-source data as seeds. Meanwhile, responses for mathematics, coding, and science tasks were generated by R1, creating specialized models for each domain. Building on this, we leveraged the Mergekit tool from the Arcee team to combine multiple models, creating Tiny-R1-32B-Preview, which demonstrates strong overall performance.

    This repository hosts model for the Open RS project, accompanying the paper Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning in Small LLMs: What Works and What Doesn’t. The project explores enhancing reasoning capabilities in small large language models (LLMs) using reinforcement learning (RL) under resource-constrained conditions.

    We focus on a 1.5-billion-parameter model, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, trained on 4 NVIDIA A40 GPUs (48 GB VRAM each) within 24 hours. By adapting the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm and leveraging a curated, compact mathematical reasoning dataset, we conducted three experiments to assess performance and behavior. Key findings include:

    Significant reasoning improvements, e.g., AMC23 accuracy rising from 63% to 80% and AIME24 reaching 46.7%, outperforming o1-preview.
    Efficient training with just 7,000 samples at a cost of $42, compared to thousands of dollars for baseline models.
    Challenges like optimization instability and length constraints with extended training.

    These results showcase RL-based fine-tuning as a cost-effective approach for small LLMs, making reasoning capabilities accessible in resource-limited settings. We open-source our code, models, and datasets to support further research.

  description: |
    We're thrilled to introduce AceReason-Nemotron-14B, a math and code reasoning model trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL), starting from the DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-14B. It delivers impressive results, achieving 78.6% on AIME 2024 (+8.9%), 67.4% on AIME 2025 (+17.4%), 61.1% on LiveCodeBench v5 (+8%), 54.9% on LiveCodeBench v6 (+7%), and 2024 on Codeforces (+543). We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first RL training on math-only prompts, then RL training on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks, but also code reasoning tasks. In addition, extended code-only RL further improves code benchmark performance while causing minimal degradation in math results. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pre-training and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.

    FairyR1-14B-Preview, a highly efficient large-language-model (LLM) that matches or exceeds larger models on select tasks. Built atop the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B base, this model continues to utilize the 'distill-and-merge' pipeline from TinyR1-32B-Preview and Fairy-32B, combining task-focused fine-tuning with model-merging techniques—to deliver competitive performance with drastically reduced size and inference cost. This project was funded by NSFC, Grant 624B2005.

    As a member of the FairyR1 series, FairyR1-14B-Preview shares the same training data and process as FairyR1-32B. We strongly recommend using the FairyR1-32B, which achieves comparable performance in math and coding to deepseek-R1-671B with only 5% of the parameters. For more details, please view the page of FairyR1-32B.
    The FairyR1 model represents a further exploration of our earlier work TinyR1, retaining the core “Branch-Merge Distillation” approach while introducing refinements in data processing and model architecture.

    In this effort, we overhauled the distillation data pipeline: raw examples from datasets such as AIMO/NuminaMath-1.5 for mathematics and OpenThoughts-114k for code were first passed through multiple 'teacher' models to generate candidate answers. These candidates were then carefully selected, restructured, and refined, especially for the chain-of-thought(CoT). Subsequently, we applied multi-stage filtering—including automated correctness checks for math problems and length-based selection (2K–8K tokens for math samples, 4K–8K tokens for code samples). This yielded two focused training sets of roughly 6.6K math examples and 3.8K code examples.

    On the modeling side, rather than training three separate specialists as before, we limited our scope to just two domain experts (math and code), each trained independently under identical hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate and batch size) for about five epochs. We then fused these experts into a single 14B-parameter model using the AcreeFusion tool. By streamlining both the data distillation workflow and the specialist-model merging process, FairyR1 achieves task-competitive results with only a fraction of the parameters and computational cost of much larger models.

    The Tifa role-playing language model is a high-performance language model based on a self-developed 220B model distillation, with a new base model of qwen2-7B. The model has been converted to gguf format for running in the Ollama framework, providing excellent dialogue and text generation capabilities.

    The original model was trained on a large-scale industrial dataset and then fine-tuned with 400GB of novel data and 20GB of multi-round dialogue directive data to achieve good role-playing effects.

    The Tifa model is suitable for multi-round dialogue processing, role-playing and scenario simulation, EFX industrial knowledge integration, and high-quality literary creation.

    Note: The Tifa model is in Chinese and English, with 7.6% of the data in Chinese role-playing and 4.2% in English role-playing. The model has been trained with a mix of EFX industrial field parameters and question-answer dialogues generated from 220B model outputs since 2023. The recommended quantization method is f16, as it retains more detail and accuracy in the model's performance.

    NOTE: As explained on Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 repo, it's recommended to use a low temperature, please experiment!

    Lumimaid 0.1 -> 0.2 is a HUGE step up dataset wise.

    As some people have told us our models are sloppy, Ikari decided to say fuck it and literally nuke all chats out with most slop.

    Our dataset stayed the same since day one, we added data over time, cleaned them, and repeat. After not releasing model for a while because we were never satisfied, we think it's time to come back!

    Welcome to the next iteration of my Pantheon model series, in which I strive to introduce a whole collection of personas that can be summoned with a simple activation phrase. The huge variety in personalities introduced also serve to enhance the general roleplay experience.
    Changes in version 1.6:
    The final finetune now consists of data that is equally split between Markdown and novel-style roleplay. This should solve Pantheon's greatest weakness.
    The base was redone. (Details below)
    Select Claude-specific phrases were rewritten, boosting variety in the model's responses.
    Aiva no longer serves as both persona and assistant, with the assistant role having been given to Lyra.
    Stella's dialogue received some post-fix alterations since the model really loved the phrase "Fuck me sideways".
    Your user feedback is critical to me so don't hesitate to tell me whether my model is either 1. terrible, 2. awesome or 3. somewhere in-between.

    This is a group-chat based roleplaying model, based off of 12B-Lyra-v4a2, a variant of Lyra-v4 that is currently private.

    It is trained on an entirely human-based dataset, based on forum / internet group roleplaying styles. The only augmentation done with LLMs is to the character sheets, to fit to the system prompt, to fit various character sheets within context.

    This model is still capable of 1 on 1 roleplay, though I recommend using ChatML when doing that instead.

    v2.5 KTO is an experimental release; we are testing a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy of KTO + DPOP, using rejected data sampled from the original model as "rejected". For "chosen", we use data from the original finetuning dataset as "chosen". This was done on a limited portion of of primarily instruction following data; we plan to scale up a larger KTO dataset in the future for better generalization. This is the 5th in a series of models designed to replicate the prose quality of the Claude 3 models, specifically Sonnet and Opus. This model is fine-tuned on top of anthracite-org/magnum-12b-v2.

    I had originally planned to use this model for future/further merges, but decided to go ahead and release it since it scored rather high on my local EQ Bench testing (79.58 w/ 100% parsed @ 8-bit).
    Bear in mind that most models tend to score a bit higher on my own local tests as compared to their posted scores. Still, its the highest score I've personally seen from all the models I've tested.
    Its a decent model, with great emotional intelligence and acceptable adherence to various character personalities. It does a good job at roleplaying despite being a bit bland at times.

    Overall, I like the way it writes, but it has a few formatting issues that show up from time to time, and it has an uncommon tendency to paste walls of character feelings/intentions at the end of some outputs without any prompting. This is something I hope to correct with future iterations.

    Chronos Gold 12B 1.0 is a very unique model that applies to domain areas such as general chatbot functionatliy, roleplay, and storywriting. The model has been observed to write up to 2250 tokens in a single sequence. The model was trained at a sequence length of 16384 (16k) and will still retain the apparent 128k context length from Mistral-Nemo, though it deteriorates over time like regular Nemo does based on the RULER Test

    As a result, is recommended to keep your sequence length max at 16384, or you will experience performance degredation.

    The base model is mistralai/Mistral-Nemo-Base-2407 which was heavily modified to produce a more coherent model, comparable to much larger models.

    Chronos Gold 12B-1.0 re-creates the uniqueness of the original Chronos with significiantly enhanced prompt adherence (following), coherence, a modern dataset, as well as supporting a majority of "character card" formats in applications like SillyTavern.

    It went through an iterative and objective merge process as my previous models and was further finetuned on a dataset curated for it.

    The specifics of the model will not be disclosed at the time due to dataset ownership.

  description: |
    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit. Mag Mell is a multi-stage merge, Inspired by hyper-merges like Tiefighter and Umbral Mind. Intended to be a general purpose "Best of Nemo" model for any fictional, creative use case.
    6 models were chosen based on 3 categories; they were then paired up and merged via layer-weighted SLERP to create intermediate "specialists" which are then evaluated in their domain. The specialists were then merged into the base via DARE-TIES, with hyperparameters chosen to reduce interference caused by the overlap of the three domains. The idea with this approach is to extract the best qualities of each component part, and produce models whose task vectors represent more than the sum of their parts.

    The three specialists are as follows:
        Hero (RP, kink/trope coverage): Chronos Gold, Sunrose.
        Monk (Intelligence, groundedness): Bophades, Wissenschaft.
        Deity (Prose, flair): Gutenberg v4, Magnum 2.5 KTO.
    I've been dreaming about this merge since Nemo tunes started coming out in earnest. From our testing, Mag Mell demonstrates worldbuilding capabilities unlike any model in its class, comparable to old adventuring models like Tiefighter, and prose that exhibits minimal "slop" (not bad for no finetuning,) frequently devising electrifying metaphors that left us consistently astonished.

    I don't want to toot my own bugle though; I'm really proud of how this came out, but please leave your feedback, good or bad.Special thanks as usual to Toaster for his feedback and Fizz for helping fund compute, as well as the KoboldAI Discord for their resources.

    We’ve heard over and over from AI Dungeon players that modern AI models are too nice, never letting them fail or die. While it may be good for a chatbot to be nice and helpful, great stories and games aren’t all rainbows and unicorns. They have conflict, tension, and even death. These create real stakes and consequences for characters and the journeys they go on.

    Similarly, great games need opposition. You must be able to fail, die, and may even have to start over. This makes games more fun!

    However, the vast majority of AI models, through alignment RLHF, have been trained away from darkness, violence, or conflict, preventing them from fulfilling this role. To give our players better options, we decided to train our own model to fix these issues.

    Wayfarer is an adventure role-play model specifically trained to give players a challenging and dangerous experience. We thought they would like it, but since releasing it on AI Dungeon, players have reacted even more positively than we expected.

    Because they loved it so much, we’ve decided to open-source the model so anyone can experience unforgivingly brutal AI adventures! Anyone can download the model to run locally.

    Or if you want to easily try this model for free, you can do so at https://aidungeon.com.

    We plan to continue improving and open-sourcing similar models, so please share any and all feedback on how we can improve model behavior. Below we share more details on how Wayfarer was created.

    This is a lightly fine-tuned version of the Mistral 24B base model, designed as an accessible and adaptable foundation for further fine-tuning and merging fodder. Key modifications include:
    ChatML-ified, with no additional tokens introduced.
    High quality private instruct—not generated by ChatGPT or Claude, ensuring no slop and good markdown understanding.
    No refusals—since it’s a base model, refusals should be minimal to non-existent, though, in early testing, occasional warnings still appear (I assume some were baked into the pre-train).
    High-quality private creative writing dataset Mainly to dilute baked-in slop further, but it can actually write some stories, not bad for loss ~8.
    Small, high-quality private RP dataset This was done so further tuning for RP will be easier. The dataset was kept small and contains ZERO SLOP, some entries are of 16k token length.
    Exceptional adherence to character cards This was done to make it easier for further tunes intended for roleplay.

    It's been a long road fraught with delays, technical issues and us banging our heads against the wall, but we're glad to say that we've returned to open-source roleplaying with our newest model, Pygmalion-3. We've taken Mistral's Nemo base model and fed it hundreds of millions of tokens of conversations, creative writing and instructions to create a model dedicated towards roleplaying that we hope fulfills your expectations.

    As part of our open-source roots and promises to those who have been with us since the beginning, we release this model under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, allowing anyone to use and develop upon our work for everybody in the local models community.

  description: |
    DeepHermes 3 Preview is the latest version of our flagship Hermes series of LLMs by Nous Research, and one of the first models in the world to unify Reasoning (long chains of thought that improve answer accuracy) and normal LLM response modes into one model. We have also improved LLM annotation, judgement, and function calling.

    DeepHermes 3 Preview is a hybrid reasoning model, and one of the first LLM models to unify both "intuitive", traditional mode responses and long chain of thought reasoning responses into a single model, toggled by a system prompt.

    Hermes 3, the predecessor of DeepHermes 3, is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board.

    The ethos of the Hermes series of models is focused on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user.

    This is a preview Hermes with early reasoning capabilities, distilled from R1 across a variety of tasks that benefit from reasoning and objectivity. Some quirks may be discovered! Please let us know any interesting findings or issues you discover!

    The prompt formatting and usage should be the same as with QwQ; Use ChatML, and remove the thinking from previous turns. If thoughts arent being generated automatically, add <think>\n to the start of the assistant turn.

    It should follow previous model turns formatting. On first turns of the conversation you may need to regen a few times, and maybe edit the model responses for the first few turns to get it to your liking.

    This model is a merge between Trappu/Nemo-Picaro-12B, a model trained on my own little dataset free of synthetic data, which focuses solely on storywriting and scenrio prompting (Example: [ Scenario: bla bla bla; Tags: bla bla bla ]), and anthracite-org/magnum-v2-12b.

    The reason why I decided to merge it with Magnum (and don't recommend Picaro alone) is because that model, aside from its obvious flaws (rampant impersonation, stupid, etc...), is a one-trick pony and will be really rough for the average LLM user to handle. The idea was to have Magnum work as some sort of stabilizer to fix the issues that emerge from the lack of multiturn/smart data in Picaro's dataset. It worked, I think. I enjoy the outputs and it's smart enough to work with.

    But yeah the goal of this merge was to make a model that's both good at storytelling/narration but also fine when it comes to other forms of creative writing such as RP or chatting. I don't think it's quite there yet but it's something for sure.

Varied rerolls, good character/scenario handling, almost no user impersonation now. Huge dependence on intro message quality, but lets it follow up messages from larger models quite nicely. Currently considering it as an overall improvement over v0 as far as tester feedback is concerned. Still seeing some slop and an occasional bad reroll response, though.

  description: |
    Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506 is a minor update of Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503.

    Small-3.2 improves in the following categories:

        Instruction following: Small-3.2 is better at following precise instructions
        Repetition errors: Small-3.2 produces less infinite generations or repetitive answers
        Function calling: Small-3.2's function calling template is more robust (see here and examples)

    In all other categories Small-3.2 should match or slightly improve compared to Mistral-Small-3.1-24B-Instruct-2503.

    This is a finetune of Harbinger 24B to be a generalist Roleplay/Adventure model. I've removed some of the "slops" that i noticed in an otherwise great model aswell as improving the general writing of the model, This was a multi-stage finetune, all previous checkpoints are released aswell.

    Mistral-Small-3.2-46B-The-Brilliant-Raconteur-II-Instruct-2506

    This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

    ABOUT:

    A stronger, more creative Mistral (Mistral-Small-3.2-24B-Instruct-2506) extended to 79 layers, 46B parameters with Brainstorm 40x by DavidAU (details at very bottom of the page). This is version II, which has a jump in detail, and raw emotion relative to version 1.

    This model pushes Mistral's Instruct 2506 to the limit:

        Regens will be very different, even with same prompt / settings.
        Output generation will vary vastly on each generation.
        Reasoning will be changed, and often shorter.
        Prose, creativity, word choice, and general "flow" are improved.
        Several system prompts below help push this model even further.
        Model is partly de-censored / abliterated. Most Mistrals are more uncensored that most other models too.
        This model can also be used for coding too; even at low quants.
        Model can be used for all use cases too.

    As this is an instruct model, this model thrives on instructions - both in the system prompt and/or the prompt itself.

    One example below with 3 generations using Q4_K_S.

    Second example below with 2 generations using Q4_K_S.

    Quick Details:

        Model is 128k context, Jinja template (embedded) OR Chatml Template.
        Reasoning can be turned on/off (see system prompts below) and is OFF by default.
        Temp range .1 to 1 suggested, with 1-2 for enhanced creative. Above temp 2, is strong but can be very different.
        Rep pen range: 1 (off) or very light 1.01, 1.02 to 1.05. (model is sensitive to rep pen - this affects reasoning / generation length.)
        For creative/brainstorming use: suggest 2-5 generations due to variations caused by Brainstorm.

    Observations:

        Sometimes using Chatml (or Alpaca / others ) template (VS Jinja) will result in stronger creative generation.
        Model can be operated with NO system prompt; however a system prompt will enhance generation.
        Longer prompts, that more detailed, with more instructions will result in much stronger generations.
        For prose directives: You may need to add directions, because the model may follow your instructions too closely. IE: "use short sentences" vs "use short sentences sparsely".
        Reasoning (on) can lead to better creative generation, however sometimes generation with reasoning off is better.
        Rep pen of up to 1.05 may be needed on quants Q2k/q3ks for some prompts to address "low bit" issues.

    Detailed settings, system prompts, how to and examples below.

    NOTES:

    Image generation should also be possible with this model, just like the base model. Brainstorm was not applied to the image generation systems of the model... yet.

    This is Version II and subject to change / revision.

    This model is a slightly different version of:

    Another experimental release. Mistral Small 3.2 24B upscaled by 18 layers to create a 33.6B model. This model then went through pretraining, SFT & DPO.

    Can't guarantee the Mistral 3.2 repetition issues are fixed, but this model seems to be less repetitive than my previous attempt.

    This is an uncensored creative model intended to excel at character driven RP / ERP where characters are portrayed creatively and proactively.

  description: |
    Dolphin Mistral 24B Venice Edition is a collaborative project we undertook with Venice.ai with the goal of creating the most uncensored version of Mistral 24B for use within the Venice ecosystem.

    Dolphin Mistral 24B Venice Edition is now live on https://venice.ai/ as “Venice Uncensored,” the new default model for all Venice users.

    Dolphin aims to be a general purpose model, similar to the models behind ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. But these models present problems for businesses seeking to include AI in their products.

        They maintain control of the system prompt, deprecating and changing things as they wish, often causing software to break.
        They maintain control of the model versions, sometimes changing things silently, or deprecating older models that your business relies on.
        They maintain control of the alignment, and in particular the alignment is one-size-fits all, not tailored to the application.
        They can see all your queries and they can potentially use that data in ways you wouldn't want. Dolphin, in contrast, is steerable and gives control to the system owner. You set the system prompt. You decide the alignment. You have control of your data. Dolphin does not impose its ethics or guidelines on you. You are the one who decides the guidelines.

    Dolphin belongs to YOU, it is your tool, an extension of your will. Just as you are personally responsible for what you do with a knife, gun, fire, car, or the internet, you are the creator and originator of any content you generate with Dolphin.

    Seriously off the scale coding power.

    TWO monster coders (Magistral 24B AND Devstral 24B) in MOE (Mixture of Experts) 2x24B configuration with full reasoning (can be turned on/off).

    The two best Mistral Coders at 24B each in one MOE MODEL (44B) that is stronger than the sum of their parts with 128k context.

    Both models code together, with Magistral in "charge" using Devstral's coding power.

    Full reasoning/thinking which can be turned on or off.

    GGUFs enhanced using NEO Imatrix dataset, and further enhanced with output tensor at bf16 (16 bit full precision).

  description: "It's the 20th of June, 2025—The world is getting more and more chaotic, but let's look at the bright side: Mistral released a new model at a very good size of 24B, no more \"sign here\" or \"accept this weird EULA\" there, a proper Apache 2.0 License, nice! \U0001F44D\U0001F3FB\n\nThis model is based on mistralai/Magistral-Small-2506 so naturally I named it Impish_Magic. Truly excellent size, I tested it on my laptop (16GB gpu) and it works quite fast (4090m).\n\nThis model went \"full\" fine-tune over 100m unique tokens. Why do I say \"full\"?\n\nI've tuned specific areas in the model to attempt to change the vocabulary usage, while keeping as much intelligence as possible. So this is definitely not a LoRA, but also not exactly a proper full finetune, but rather something in-between.\n\nAs I mentioned in a small update, I've made nice progress regarding interesting sources of data, some of them are included in this tune. 100m tokens is a lot for a Roleplay / Adventure tune, and yes, it can do adventure as well—there is unique adventure data here, that was never used so far.\n\nA lot of the data still needs to be cleaned and processed. I've included it before I did any major data processing, because with the magic of 24B parameters, even \"dirty\" data would work well, especially when using a more \"balanced\" approach for tuning that does not include burning the hell of the model in a full finetune across all of its layers. Could this data be cleaner? Of course, and it will. But for now, I would hate to make perfect the enemy of the good.\nFun fact: Impish_Magic_24B is the first roleplay finetune of magistral!\n"

Oh, and regarding following the character card: It somehow gotten even better, to the point of it being straight up uncanny \U0001F643 (I had to check twice that this model was loaded, and not some 70B!)\n\nI feel like this model could easily replace models much larger than itself for adventure or roleplay, for assistant tasks, obviously not, but the creativity here? Off the charts. Characters have never felt so alive and in the moment before — they’ll use insinuation, manipulation, and, if needed (or provoked) — force. They feel so very present.\n\nThat look on Neo’s face when he opened his eyes and said, “I know Kung Fu”? Well, Impish_Nemo_12B had pretty much the same moment — and it now knows more than just Kung Fu, much, much more. It wasn’t easy, and it’s a niche within a niche, but as promised almost half a year ago — it is now done.\n\nImpish_Nemo_12B is smart, sassy, creative, and got a lot of unhingedness too — these are baked-in deep into every interaction. It took the innate Mistral's relative freedom, and turned it up to 11. It very well maybe too much for many, but after testing and interacting with so many models, I find this 'edge' of sorts, rather fun and refreshing.\n\nAnyway, the dataset used is absolutely massive, tons of new types of data and new domains of knowledge (Morrowind fandom, fighting, etc...). The whole dataset is a very well-balanced mix, and resulted in a model with extremely strong common sense for a 12B. Regarding response length — there's almost no response-length bias here, this one is very much dynamic and will easily adjust reply length based on 1–3 examples of provided dialogue.\n\nOh, and the model comes with 3 new Character Cards, 2 Roleplay and 1 Adventure!\n"

    This is a finetune on top of my Impish_Nemo_12B, the goal was to improve long context understanding, as well as adding support for slavic languages. For more details look at Impish_Nemo_12B's model card.
    So is this model "better"?
    Hard to say, tuning on top of a model often changes it in unpredictable ways, and I really like Impish_Nemo. In short, this tune might dillute some of the style that made it great, or for some, this might be a huge improvement, to each their own, as they say, so just use the one you have most fun with.

    EMO-2B: Emotionally Intelligent Conversational AI

    Overview:
    EMO-2B is a state-of-the-art conversational AI model with 2.5 billion parameters, designed to engage in emotionally resonant dialogue. Building upon the success of EMO-1.5B, this model has been further fine-tuned on an extensive corpus of emotional narratives, enabling it to perceive and respond to the emotional undertones of user inputs with exceptional empathy and emotional intelligence.

    Key Features:

    - Advanced Emotional Intelligence: With its increased capacity, EMO-2B demonstrates an even deeper understanding and generation of emotional language, allowing for more nuanced and contextually appropriate emotional responses.
    - Enhanced Contextual Awareness: The model considers an even broader context within conversations, accounting for subtle emotional cues and providing emotionally resonant responses tailored to the specific situation.
    - Empathetic and Supportive Dialogue: EMO-2B excels at active listening, validating emotions, offering compassionate advice, and providing emotional support, making it an ideal companion for users seeking empathy and understanding.
    - Dynamic Persona Adaptation: The model can dynamically adapt its persona, communication style, and emotional responses to match the user's emotional state, ensuring a highly personalized and tailored conversational experience.

    Use Cases:

    EMO-2B is well-suited for a variety of applications where emotional intelligence and empathetic communication are crucial, such as:

    - Mental health support chatbots
    - Emotional support companions
    - Personalized coaching and motivation
    - Narrative storytelling and interactive fiction
    - Customer service and support (for emotionally sensitive contexts)

    Limitations and Ethical Considerations:

    While EMO-2B is designed to provide emotionally intelligent and empathetic responses, it is important to note that it is an AI system and cannot replicate the depth and nuance of human emotional intelligence. Users should be aware that the model's responses, while emotionally supportive, should not be considered a substitute for professional mental health support or counseling.

    Additionally, as with any language model, EMO-2B may reflect biases present in its training data. Users should exercise caution and critical thinking when interacting with the model, and report any concerning or inappropriate responses.

    The abliteration script (link) is based on code from the blog post and heavily uses TransformerLens. The only major difference from the code used for Llama is scaling the embedding layer back.

    Orthogonalization did not produce the same results as regular interventions since there are RMSNorm layers before merging activations into the residual stream. However, the final model still seems to be uncensored.

    This is a creative writing merge of two very different models that I trained on the brand new Gutenberg3 dataset, plus Ataraxy-v2 in the mix.

    It's lost much of the slop and tryhard vocab flexing and positivity bias that's typical of these models and writes in its own voice.

    The main source model in the merge, Quill-v1, inherited a natural, spare prose from the human writing in the gutenberg set. The other source model, Delirium-v1, got overcooked in SIMPO training; it has crazy panache, a really dark flair for the grotesque, and has some mental issues. These two source models balance each other out in the merge, resulting in something pretty unique.

    It seems to be quite uncensored and creative. Since Delirium was pushed right to the edge during training, the merge may exhibit some of its weirdness and word / concept fixations. This may be mitigated by using custom anti-slop lists.

    The payoff is a really creative, stream of consciousness style of writing, with punchy dialogue that I haven't seen in other models. Oh, it also scored around the top of the EQ-Bench creative writing leaderboard!

    Quill is a capable, humanlike writing model trained on a large dataset of late 19th and early 20th century writing from the Gutenberg Project. This model writes with a natural cadence and low gpt-slop, having inherited some human qualities from the Gutenberg3 dataset. It writes with more simple, spare prose than the typical overly-adjectived LLM writing style.

    This model was trained using gemma-2-9b-it as the base. The training methods used were ORPO (gently) then SIMPO (less gently).

    It's trained on an experimental gutenberg + antislop dataset. This contains the original two gutenberg sets by jondurbin and nbeerbower, as well as a subset of my own set, gutenberg3. The antislop pairs were generated with gemma-2-9b-it, with one sample generated with the AntiSlop sampler and the rejected sample generated without.

    A merge of Sugarquill and Sunfall. I wanted to combine Sugarquill's more novel-like writing style with something that would improve it's RP perfomance and make it more steerable, w/o adding superfluous synthetic writing patterns.

    I quite like Crestfall's Sunfall models and I felt like Gemma version of Sunfall will steer the model in this direction when merged in. To keep more of Gemma-2-9B-it-SPPO-iter3's smarts, I've decided to apply Sunfall LoRA on top of it, instead of using the published Sunfall model.

    I'm generally pleased with the result, this model has nice, fresh writing style, good charcard adherence and good system prompt following. It still should work well for raw completion storywriting, as it's a trained feature in both merged models.

    An experimental continued pretrain of Gemma-2-9B-It-SPPO-Iter3 on assorted short story data from the web. I was trying to diversify Gemma's prose, without completely destroying it's smarts. I think I half-succeeded? This model could have used another epoch of training, but even this is already more creative and descriptive than it's base model, w/o becoming too silly. Doesn't seem to have degraded much in terms of core abilities as well. Should be usable both for RP and raw completion storywriting. I originally planned to use this in a merge, but I feel like this model is interesting enough to be released on it's own as well.

    Model was trained by Auri.

    Dedicated to Cahvay, who wanted a Gemma finetune from me for months by now, and to La Rata, who loves storywriter models.

    INSAIT introduces BgGPT-Gemma-2-2.6B-IT-v1.0, a state-of-the-art Bulgarian language model based on google/gemma-2-2b and google/gemma-2-2b-it. BgGPT-Gemma-2-2.6B-IT-v1.0 is free to use and distributed under the Gemma Terms of Use. This model was created by INSAIT, part of Sofia University St. Kliment Ohridski, in Sofia, Bulgaria.
    The model was built on top of Google’s Gemma 2 2B open models. It was continuously pre-trained on around 100 billion tokens (85 billion in Bulgarian) using the Branch-and-Merge strategy INSAIT presented at EMNLP’24, allowing the model to gain outstanding Bulgarian cultural and linguistic capabilities while retaining its English performance. During the pre-training stage, we use various datasets, including Bulgarian web crawl data, freely available datasets such as Wikipedia, a range of specialized Bulgarian datasets sourced by the INSAIT Institute, and machine translations of popular English datasets. The model was then instruction-fine-tuned on a newly constructed Bulgarian instruction dataset created using real-world conversations. For more information check our blogpost.

    We present FuseChat-3.0, a series of models crafted to enhance performance by integrating the strengths of multiple source LLMs into more compact target LLMs. To achieve this fusion, we utilized four powerful source LLMs: Gemma-2-27B-It, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2407, Qwen-2.5-72B-Instruct, and Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct. For the target LLMs, we employed three widely-used smaller models—Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-9B-It, and Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct—along with two even more compact models—Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct and Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct. The implicit model fusion process involves a two-stage training pipeline comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to mitigate distribution discrepancies between target and source LLMs, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for learning preferences from multiple source LLMs. The resulting FuseChat-3.0 models demonstrated substantial improvements in tasks related to general conversation, instruction following, mathematics, and coding. Notably, when Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct served as the target LLM, our fusion approach achieved an average improvement of 6.8 points across 14 benchmarks. Moreover, it showed significant improvements of 37.1 and 30.1 points on instruction-following test sets AlpacaEval-2 and Arena-Hard respectively. We have released the FuseChat-3.0 models on Huggingface, stay tuned for the forthcoming dataset and code.

    Meta developed and released the Meta Llama 3 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and instruction tuned generative text models in 8 and 70B sizes. The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Further, in developing these models, we took great care to optimize helpfulness and safety.

    Model developers Meta

    Variations Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters — in pre-trained and instruction tuned variants.

    Input Models input text only.

    Output Models generate text and code only.

    Model Architecture Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.

    This was an experiment to see if aligning other models via LORA is possible. Yes it is. We aligned it to be always horny.

    We took V3.3 Stheno weights from here

    And applied our lora at Alpha = 768

    Thank you to Sao10K for the amazing model.

    L3-Aethora-15B was crafted through using the abilteration method to adjust model responses. The model's refusal is inhibited, focusing on yielding more compliant and facilitative dialogue interactions. It then underwent a modified DUS (Depth Up Scale) merge (originally used by @Elinas) by using passthrough merge to create a 15b model, with specific adjustments (zeroing) to 'o_proj' and 'down_proj', enhancing its efficiency and reducing perplexity. This created AbL3In-15b.

    This MoE merge is meant to compete with Mixtral fine-tunes, more specifically Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO, which I think is the best of them. I've done a bunch of side-by-side comparisons, and while I can't say it wins in every aspect, it's very close. Some of its shortcomings are multilingualism, storytelling, and roleplay, despite using models that are very good at those tasks.

        You might be assigned a random name if you don't give yourself one.
        Chat format was pretty stale?

    Disclaimer

    TherapyLlama is NOT a real therapist. It is a friendly AI that mimics empathy and psychotherapy. It is an illusion without the slightest clue who you are as a person. As much as it can help you with self-discovery, A LLAMA IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE to a real professional.

    Llama3 trained on our RP datasets, we tried to have a balance between the ERP and the RP, not too horny, but just enough.

    We also added some non-RP dataset, making the model less dumb overall. It should look like a 40%/60% ratio for Non-RP/RP+ERP data.

     We release an unofficial checkpoint of a state-of-the-art instruct model of its class, LLaMA3-iterative-DPO-final. On all three widely-used instruct model benchmarks: Alpaca-Eval-V2, MT-Bench, Chat-Arena-Hard, our model outperforms all models of similar size (e.g., LLaMA-3-8B-it), most large open-sourced models (e.g., Mixtral-8x7B-it), and strong proprietary models (e.g., GPT-3.5-turbo-0613). The model is trained with open-sourced datasets without any additional human-/GPT4-labeling.

    This model is a multi-level SLERP merge of several Llama 3 70B variants. See the merge recipe below for details. I extended the context window for this model out to 32K by snagging some layers from abacusai/Smaug-Llama-3-70B-Instruct-32K using a technique similar to what I used for Midnight Miqu, which was further honed by jukofyork.
    This model is uncensored. You are responsible for whatever you do with it.

    This model was designed for roleplaying and storytelling and I think it does well at both. It may also perform well at other tasks but I have not tested its performance in other areas.

    This is a direct upgrade over cat 70B, with 2x the dataset size(2GB-> 5GB), added Chinese support with quality on par with the original English dataset. The medical COT portion of the dataset has been sponsored by steelskull, and the action packed character play portion was donated by Gryphe's(aesir dataset). Note that 8b is based on llama3 with limited Chinese support due to base model choice. The chat format in 8b is llama3. The 72b has more comprehensive Chinese support and the format will be chatml.

    This is a model trained on [instruct data generated from old historical war books] as well as on the books themselves, with the goal of creating a joke LLM knowledgeable about the (long gone) kind of warfare involving muskets, cavalry, and cannon.

    This model can provide good answers, but it turned out to be pretty fragile during conversation for some reason: open-ended questions can make it spout nonsense. Asking facts is more reliable but not guaranteed to work.

    The basic guide to getting good answers is: be specific with your questions. Use specific terms and define a concrete scenario, if you can, otherwise the LLM will often hallucinate the rest. I think the issue was that I did not train with a large enough system prompt: not enough latent space is being activated by default. (I'll try to correct this in future runs).

    Rebuilt and Powered Up.

    WARNING: NSFW. Graphic HORROR. Extreme swearing. UNCENSORED. SMART.

    The author took the original models in "L3-Stheno-Maid-Blackroot 8B" and completely rebuilt it a new pass-through merge (everything preserved) and blew it out to over 16.5 billion parameters - 642 tensors, 71 layers (8B original has 32 layers).

    This is not an "upscale" or "franken merge" but a completely new model based on the models used to construct "L3-Stheno-Maid-Blackroot 8B".

    The result is a take no prisoners, totally uncensored, fiction writing monster and roleplay master as well just about... any general fiction activity "AI guru" including scene generation and scene continuation.

    As a result of the expansion / merge re-build its level of prose and story generation has significantly improved as well as word choice, sentence structure as well as default output levels and lengths.

    It also has a STRONG horror bias, although it will generate content for almost any genre. That being said if there is a "hint" of things going wrong... they will.

    It will also swear (R-18) like there is no tomorrow at times and "dark" characters will be VERY dark so to speak.

    Model is excels in details (real and "constructed"), descriptions, similes and metaphors.

    It can have a sense of humor ... ah... dark humor.

    Because of the nature of this merge most attributes of each of the 3 models will be in this rebuilt 16.5B model as opposed to the original 8B model where some of one or more of the model's features and/or strengths maybe reduced or overshadowed.

    Meta-Llama-3-8B Instruct (now at 12.2B) with Brainstorm process that increases its performance at the core level for any creative use case. It has calibrations that allow it to exceed the logic solving abilities of the original model. The Brainstorm process expands the reasoning center of the LLM, reassembles and calibrates it, introducing subtle changes into the reasoning process. This enhances the model's detail, concept, connection to the "world", general concept connections, prose quality, and prose length without affecting instruction following. It improves coherence, description, simile, metaphors, emotional engagement, and takes fewer liberties with instructions while following them more closely. The model's performance is further enhanced by other technologies like "Ultra" (precision), "Neo Imatrix" (custom imatrix datasets), and "X-quants" (custom application of the imatrix process). It has been tested on multiple LLaMA2, LLaMA3, and Mistral models of various parameter sizes.

    WhiteRabbitNeo is a model series that can be used for offensive and defensive cybersecurity.
    Topics Covered:
    - Open Ports: Identifying open ports is crucial as they can be entry points for attackers. Common ports to check include HTTP (80, 443), FTP (21), SSH (22), and SMB (445).
    - Outdated Software or Services: Systems running outdated software or services are often vulnerable to exploits. This includes web servers, database servers, and any third-party software.
    - Default Credentials: Many systems and services are installed with default usernames and passwords, which are well-known and can be easily exploited.
    - Misconfigurations: Incorrectly configured services, permissions, and security settings can introduce vulnerabilities.
    - Injection Flaws: SQL injection, command injection, and cross-site scripting (XSS) are common issues in web applications.
    - Unencrypted Services: Services that do not use encryption (like HTTP instead of HTTPS) can expose sensitive data.
    - Known Software Vulnerabilities: Checking for known vulnerabilities in software using databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or tools like Nessus or OpenVAS.
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): This is where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.
    - Insecure Direct Object References: This occurs when an application provides direct access to objects based on user-supplied input.
    - Security Misconfigurations in Web Servers/Applications: This includes issues like insecure HTTP headers or verbose error messages that reveal too much information.
    - Broken Authentication and Session Management: This can allow attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users' identities.
    - Sensitive Data Exposure: Includes vulnerabilities that expose sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, health records, or personal information.
    - API Vulnerabilities: In modern web applications, APIs are often used and can have vulnerabilities like insecure endpoints or data leakage.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities: Identifying services that are vulnerable to DoS attacks, which can make the resource unavailable to legitimate users.
    - Buffer Overflows: Common in older software, these vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to crash the system or execute arbitrary code.

    Introducing Llama-3-SEC: a state-of-the-art domain-specific large language model that is set to revolutionize the way we analyze and understand SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) data. Built upon the powerful Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct model, Llama-3-SEC is being trained on a vast corpus of SEC filings and related financial information. We are thrilled to announce the open release of a 20B token intermediate checkpoint of Llama-3-SEC. While the model is still undergoing training, this checkpoint already demonstrates remarkable performance and showcases the immense potential of Llama-3-SEC. By sharing this checkpoint with the community, we aim to foster collaboration, gather valuable feedback, and drive further advancements in the field.

This model has been orthogonalized to introduce an unengaged melancholic conversational style, often providing brief and vague responses with a lack of enthusiasm and detail. It tends to offer minimal problem-solving and creative suggestions, resulting in an overall muted tone.

    Model card description:
    As of June 11, 2024, I've finally started training the model! The training is progressing smoothly, although it will take some time. I used a combination of model merges and an abliterated model as base, followed by a comprehensive deep unalignment protocol to unalign the model to its core. A common issue with uncensoring and unaligning models is that it often significantly impacts their base intelligence. To mitigate these drawbacks, I've included a substantial corpus of common sense, theory of mind, and various other elements to counteract the effects of the deep uncensoring process. Given the extensive corpus involved, the training will require at least a week of continuous training. Expected early results: in about 3-4 days.
    Additional info:
    As of June 13, 2024, I've observed that even after two days of continuous training, the model is still resistant to learning certain aspects.
    For example, some of the validation data still shows a loss over , whereas other parts have a loss of < or lower. This is after the model was initially abliterated.
    June 18, 2024 Update, After extensive testing of the intermediate checkpoints, significant progress has been made.
    The model is slowly — I mean, really slowly — unlearning its alignment. By significantly lowering the learning rate, I was able to visibly observe deep behavioral changes, this process is taking longer than anticipated, but it's going to be worth it. Estimated time to completion: 4 more days.. I'm pleased to report that in several tests, the model not only maintained its intelligence but actually showed a slight improvement, especially in terms of common sense. An intermediate checkpoint of this model was used to create invisietch/EtherealRainbow-v0.3-rc7, with promising results. Currently, it seems like I'm on the right track. I hope this model will serve as a solid foundation for further merges, whether for role-playing (RP) or for uncensoring. This approach also allows us to save on actual fine-tuning, thereby reducing our carbon footprint. The merge process takes just a few minutes of CPU time, instead of days of GPU work.
    June 20, 2024 Update, Unaligning was partially successful, and the results are decent, but I am not fully satisfied. I decided to bite the bullet, and do a full finetune, god have mercy on my GPUs. I am also releasing the intermediate checkpoint of this model.

    Censorship level: Medium

    This model is the outcome of multiple merges, starting with the base model SicariusSicariiStuff/LLAMA-3_8B_Unaligned_Alpha. The merging process was conducted in several stages:

    Merge 1: LLAMA-3_8B_Unaligned_Alpha was SLERP merged with invisietch/EtherealRainbow-v0.3-8B.
    Merge 2: LLAMA-3_8B_Unaligned_Alpha was SLERP merged with TheDrummer/Llama-3SOME-8B-v2.
    Soup 1: Merge 1 was combined with Merge 2.
    Final Merge: Soup 1 was SLERP merged with Nitral-Archive/Hathor_Enigmatica-L3-8B-v0.4.

    The final model is surprisingly coherent (although slightly more censored), which is a bit unexpected, since all the intermediate merge steps were pretty incoherent.

    Replete-Coder-llama3-8b is a general purpose model that is specially trained in coding in over 100 coding languages. The data used to train the model contains 25% non-code instruction data and 75% coding instruction data totaling up to 3.9 million lines, roughly 1 billion tokens, or 7.27gb of instruct data. The data used to train this model was 100% uncensored, then fully deduplicated, before training happened.

    More than just a coding model!

    Although Replete-Coder has amazing coding capabilities, its trained on vaste amount of non-coding data, fully cleaned and uncensored. Dont just use it for coding, use it for all your needs! We are truly trying to make the GPT killer!

    we explore negative weight merger, and propose Orthogonalized Vector Adaptation, or OVA.

    This is a merge of pre-trained language models created using mergekit.

    "One must imagine Sisyphys happy."

    Task arithmetic was used to invert the intervention vector that was applied in MopeyMule, via application of negative weight -1.0. The combination of model weights (Instruct - MopeyMule) comprises an Orthogonalized Vector Adaptation that can subsequently be applied to the base Instruct model, and could in principle be applied to other models derived from fine-tuning the Instruct model.

    This model is meant to continue exploration of behavioral changes that can be achieved via orthogonalized steering. The result appears to be more enthusiastic and lengthy responses in chat, though it is also clear that the merged model has some unhealed damage.

    Built with Meta Llama 3.

    Nymph is the culmination of everything I have learned with the T-series project. This model aims to be a unique and full featured RP juggernaut.

    The finetune incorporates 1.6 Million tokens of RP data sourced from Bluemoon, FreedomRP, Aesir-Preview, and Claude Opus logs. I made sure to use the multi-turn sharegpt datasets this time instead of alpaca conversions. I have also included three of my personal datasets. The final touch is an ORPO based upon Openhermes Roleplay preferences.

    In the Wild West of the AI world, the real titans never hit their deadlines, no sir!
    The projects that finish on time? They’re the soft ones—basic, surface-level shenanigans. But the serious projects? They’re always delayed. You set a date, then reality hits: not gonna happen, scope creep that mutates the roadmap, unexpected turn of events that derails everything.
    It's only been 4 months since the Alpha was released, and half a year since the project started, but it felt like nearly a decade.
    Deadlines shift, but with each delay, you’re not failing—you’re refining, and becoming more ambitious. A project that keeps getting pushed isn’t late; it’s just gaining weight, becoming something worth building, and truly worth seeing all the way through. The longer it’s delayed, the more serious it gets.
    LLAMA-3_8B_Unaligned is a serious project, and thank god, the Beta is finally here.
    I love you all unconditionally, thanks for all the support and kind words!

    A girl of peculiar appetites and an even more peculiar imagination lived in a small, sleepy village nestled deep in the countryside. The kind of village where the clouds hung low, casting shadows like sullen toddlers refusing to play. But on this particular day, the girl ambled through the woods, when she noticed something curious: a plant, of all things, that seemed to have been dipped in a cookie jar, judging by its smell. A botanical biscuit, in the middle of a birch grove.
    This model is the result of training a fraction (16M tokens) of the testing data Intended for LLAMA-3_8B_Unaligned's upcoming beta. The base model is a merge of merges, made by Invisietch's and named EtherealRainbow-v0.3-8B. The name for this model reflects the base that was used for this finetune while hinting a darker, and more uncensored aspects associated with the nature of the LLAMA-3_8B_Unaligned project.

    As a result of the unique data added, this model has an exceptional adherence to instructions about paragraph length, and to the story writing prompt. I would like to emphasize, no ChatGPT \ Claude was used for any of the additional data I added in this finetune. The goal is to eventually have a model with a minimal amount of slop, this cannot be reliably done by relying on API models, which pollute datasets with their bias and repetitive words.

    Meta-Llama-3-8B Instruct (now at 8.9B) is an enhanced version of the LLM model, specifically designed for creative use cases such as story writing, roleplaying, and fiction. This model has been augmented through the "Brainstorm" process, which involves expanding and calibrating the reasoning center of the LLM to improve its performance in various creative tasks. The enhancements brought by this process include more detailed and nuanced descriptions, stronger prose, and a greater sense of immersion in the story. The model is capable of generating long and vivid content, with fewer clichés and more focused, coherent narratives. Users can provide more instructions and details to elicit stronger and more engaging responses from the model. The "Brainstorm" process has been tested on multiple LLM models, including Llama2, Llama3, and Mistral, as well as on individual models like Llama3 Instruct, Mistral Instruct, and custom fine-tuned models.

    Phillama is a model based on Phi-3-mini and trained on Llama-generated dataset raincandy-u/Dextromethorphan-10k to make it more "llama-like". Also, this model is converted into Llama format, so it will work with any Llama-2/3 workflow. The model aims to generate text with a specific "llama-like" style and is suited for text-generation tasks.

    Hermes 2 Pro is an upgraded, retrained version of Nous Hermes 2, consisting of an updated and cleaned version of the OpenHermes 2.5 Dataset, as well as a newly introduced Function Calling and JSON Mode dataset developed in-house.

    This new version of Hermes maintains its excellent general task and conversation capabilities - but also excels at Function Calling, JSON Structured Outputs, and has improved on several other metrics as well, scoring a 90% on our function calling evaluation built in partnership with Fireworks.AI, and an 81% on our structured JSON Output evaluation.

    Hermes Pro takes advantage of a special system prompt and multi-turn function calling structure with a new chatml role in order to make function calling reliable and easy to parse. Learn more about prompting below.

    This work was a collaboration between Nous Research, @interstellarninja, and Fireworks.AI

    Learn more about the function calling on our github repo here: https://github.com/NousResearch/Hermes-Function-Calling/tree/main

    Hermes 3 is a generalist language model with many improvements over Hermes 2, including advanced agentic capabilities, much better roleplaying, reasoning, multi-turn conversation, long context coherence, and improvements across the board. It is designed to focus on aligning LLMs to the user, with powerful steering capabilities and control given to the end user. The model uses ChatML as the prompt format, opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue. It also supports function calling and structured output capabilities, generalist assistant capabilities, and improved code generation skills.

  description: |
    The FLUX.1 [dev] Abliterated-v2 model is a modified version of FLUX.1 [dev] and a successor to FLUX.1 [dev] Abliterated. This version has undergone a process called unlearning, which removes the model's built-in refusal mechanism. This allows the model to respond to a wider range of prompts, including those that the original model might have deemed inappropriate or harmful.

    The abliteration process involves identifying and isolating the specific components of the model responsible for refusal behavior and then modifying or ablating those components. This results in a model that is more flexible and responsive, while still maintaining the core capabilities of the original FLUX.1 [dev] model.
